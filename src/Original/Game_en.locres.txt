Working from existing plans meant for a short design phase with the Dragoon's Zeta Battalion having one among their ranks a little over 2 years later. Only minor changes from the original mean this 'Mech remains powerfully armed. Now sporting as much armor as an Atlas, and adding jump jets make this 'Mech a terrifying sight on the battlefield. Currently under exclusive contract with Wolf's Dragoons, many military units are clamoring for Blackwell to sell to the wider arms market. Although very rarely one can be spotted outside the Dragoon ranks.

F228004640D3727F8775E3BBC2FE46AB='Crusading' Crael is an up-and-coming fighter in the DeathRain Arena on Antallos. He is known for reveling in his larger than life 'heel' personality and wild claims, both in the area and out. His Crusader has been modified to excel at short-range combat by removing the LRMs in favor of additional SRMs as well as improving its melee capabilities with a pair of custom hand acutators designed for rapid punches.

94824ADD42056E9E4E2E8CB8706AFF78='Sidewinder' was the personal BattleMech of High Lord Fransson, the leader of the Crimson Inclination rebel group. Even after his death, his followers were able to recover his 'Mech and continued to use it for a short time. While most standard configurations of the Dragon favor long range armaments and use their speed to maintain distance. Sidewinder instead has been outfitted to be faster, and hit hard at short range like its namesake.
99AEA9E34C61D15F06B270B0D195141B='The Queen of Spades', 'The First Lady of Death', and 'The Black Widow' are only some of the names applied to Natasha Kerensky. A living legend, her exploits with the Wolf's Dragoons are known in every corner of the Inner Sphere and many have declared her the deadliest MechWarrior alive. The tale of her losing her Marauder to the Bounty Hunter is well known, and every bar on every world has its own version. The one about the Black Widow Company 's blackened 'Mechs charging through the burning forests of New Delos are so widely known that many opponents have fled the battlefield simply at the sight of her jet black Warhammer.

6990CBEC410459B356C0E7B3A905131A=And we must uncover how these smugglers acquired our technology in the first place.
BAC45F2B4B846A9B30CC39902F48B05C=And we still do not have enough intel on what their numbers are like.

B07EEB8B4F6856101D0AAFBA631A4C31=Ardan Sortek reported his Victor destroyed in the fighting on Stein's Folly. Given the swift pullout by the Capellan forces, it seems unlikely that they were interested in searching the swamp for salvageable 'Mechs. As well, Sortek has been seen in a replacement Victor since. Obviously some of Stein's Folly's more industrious scavengers managed to find his original though, or...well, most of it. Many of the serial numbers on parts don't match, but enough do that this is still considered to be his old 'Mech.
7294204B491DDE3B6091558D4A13A71F=Are our ‘Mech systems not centralized? Maybe the techs can initiate remote overrides to slow them down.

Although very young, his sibko upbringing has made him a lethal killer. Despite his perfect complexion matching his naivety at the start of his journey.

Despite their modest upbringing, for nearly 50 years the Ortega family had committed their family's 'Mech, Oxide, to the services of the Silver Hawk Irregulars. Oxide's most recent pilot, Julie Ortega, was believed to be killed in action in a Steiner raid against the Coalition worlds.

With production of the ARC-2R beginning a mere 30 years after BattleMechs first took to the field, the Archer quickly became one of the most prolific chassis in the Inner Sphere. Well-armored and with a decent top speed the Archer excels in keeping enemies at long range, but pilots run the risk of overheating during high-intensity, close-quarter encounters.

Use them to sustain yourself in prolonged engagements with hostile forces. Just be sure to keep an eye on expended ammunition.

8896386B49C05A7097EE329C3B64415D=Baron Oliver Kincaid's life was filled with remarkable ups and downs. His posting with the prestigious Free Worlds Guards, his dishonorable discharge and stint as a mercenary before eventually, many years later, working his way back around to being able to show his face at the Marik Court. During his time as a mercenary serving with Nik's Cavaliers, he gave his BattleMech a name, 'Agincourt'. When prompted to explain the name, he replied that it was there to remind him how powerful turns of fate can be, and to work hard to earn back what he once had. As far as what it's armed with, a search of the cockpit found a note attached under the weapons list that read 'kitchen sink'.

7315073D48A35465B26E4DBE7D3D01C0=But no matter our plan, expect heavy resistance. If this is indeed their base of operations, they will defend it at all costs.

3F35A62E4D31E0EE315EC088D2C4C2E9=But the clan’s ambition outgrew their loyalty to Kerensky’s vision. Their callousness throughout the war was what made us decide to leave.

58AA6FFF4E1B78A137F14D8A98562489=But we will respond in kind. I refuse to allow these criminals to get the better of us. Show no mercy. We will have their defeat, here and in every battle.

5A2257C4499D29CD49534E9CB3FD353E=By Kerensky's grace, those surats did not steal any of our machines. Let us hope they did not render them inoperable. I do not wish to report lost assets.

4762DD1D49E7F9C43D6E2AB0165CE882=Cobalt, close the distance! We need to get under those guns.
45CB3E2B4AFF6ACFDA5BF48419A5892B=Cobalt, continue to advance along the waypoints.
A632708A48720FC09A6B6E8855FCFA87=Cobalt, destroy everything in the hangar. They must have thought they would hold you off long enough before you got to this stash of theirs. They will regret underestimating us.
6BFBCD0E4F3B0D2D00CB3091E177BBE5=Cobalt, detecting active artillery cannons firing on your position.
AAA36AE44AD2F894F6F29F81A18462B8=Cobalt, do not advance out into the open! Stay back and hit these surats at range with us.
8CBF9BF2463B1B230B18D1B47E3FD46E=Cobalt, enemy dropships inbound. I have no fighters to contest them!
0FE816F94F9EDA2C6974508ACDA33A28=Cobalt, enemy response forces are converging from nearby commercial hangars. That should remove all doubt about this city's complicity in hiding these dezgra raiders. They are here. Those in the city are still sheltering them. You WILL deal with both of them!
1895E24A4E31DF8D794F7F868EED462D=Cobalt, eyes up. They are sending in the heavy hitters.
6CE847FD441A8258A05F279154CF33FB=Cobalt, eyes up. We have a Leopard Inbound.
461CE27F4794B2210D661782A623F0D4=Cobalt, head on a swivel. They know we are here poking around. 
9EE80D944B2AB65D0935F090EF8D7E28=Cobalt, hostile lance moving in to reinforce.
E6E1618544DE9B80B9AEEBA7CC580467=Cobalt, if we let a single ‘Mech slip through, this op is bust. We need to push it to the limit.
F0FD5FC04E590342D2F77BB277549D54=Cobalt, listen up. The Tenth Alshain Regulars may be battered and beaten but they have yet to issue an official surrender. As I anticipated, they appear to be executing a tactical withdrawal into a region known as the Dragon’s Rift Mountains.
F93C2D79461C505A37FEF195A8924AA9=Cobalt, more enemy reinforcements are dropping in from above!
15D77DB7483D9A479D2C4C871A0482DB=Cobalt, multiple fusion reactors just powered up at the city along your route. Anticipate heavy resistance.
218920A04C3FCC1FFFA9D9BA64B4DFB9=Cobalt, my Star counted at least one reinforced ‘Mech company backed by armor and artillery. No info on what condition they are in.
E12DF4C44A4A23B3F0A09AB995A880D0=Cobalt, my Strike Star is in their flank. They are pushing the Kuritans towards you.
4978FF834BD72AA03CCA1EBDD236ED37=Cobalt, patch yourselves up then prep for immediate redeployment.  We have them on the run. We will bring a clean end to this fight. 
CA21CE38416E5A86970EEF882477A313=Cobalt, patch yourselves up then prep for immediate redeployment.  We have them on the run. We will bring a clean end to this fight. 
A95ED653442D2FF35B46C9AA0BCDFE12=Cobalt, some of my guys are tied up dead ahead of your position.
AA2CEC584207068738680FBE6C6EB4A5=Cobalt, stay sharp. Walking right into heavy fire.
12181AAC4DD6B92F49D46A8D3960D78A=Cobalt, that looks like a makeshift administration center to keep their house in order.
539A4C9446D98B1E3A724C80893ED309=Cobalt, that was an IED. Check your scanners. There may be more in the area.
6AFD70A7446DBB3CE9AC38A0D1909968=Cobalt, the Clan Watch has uncovered movement records that indicated a high-ranking Militia leader has fled to a fortified base resting on a large pocket of farmland.
0D4EEB6C433FC4886E8587857A48AB63=Cobalt, the Kuritans are fully committed now, but still no sign of a command lance. Keep your eyes open for it.
2162A58149A88CBB4AF35281D83B9C60=Cobalt, the Watch has finished its evaluation of the DropShip your Star secured at the Ant Hill. They have revealed that these mystery raiders are the Fifth Amphigean Light Assault Group, known Combine associates.
80F550634CA9A7EB6B1560BF657B81D3=Cobalt, the Watch has finished its evaluation of the DropShip your Star secured at the Ant Hill. They have revealed that these mystery raiders are the Fifth Amphigean Light Assault Group. Known Combine associates.
A3B043B343B29DED7AAD11B8641F2455=Cobalt, those ‘Mechs are valuable resources to the clan. Stop needlessly walking into mines. Use your ‘Mech's sensor scanners.
1FCB1F0D471BC442B4A10E9983CFFA29=Cobalt, use your scanners to find any surprises left by Valasek. Disable all you come across. You should consider delegating tasks to your starmates if you perform the scans yourself.
C4A778014D19DA5B1EF4189A18301044=Cobalt, we are detecting multiple fusion cores activating in the proximity of your position.
7DE98AD442698DA042B9418391A75475=Cobalt, we are touching down North of your position to assist. Moving in now to engage the enemy.
8E01EC1B471CF118266F679BBF855562=Cobalt, we are tracking at least a company’s worth of ‘Mechs inbound on your position. Your window for extraction is tightening! Get a move on it!
6658D94B405B5C4CB1B2B3A50A951655=Cobalt, we estimate you have a minute before our target takes off! Finish the job! Or face my wrath!
307969D24B36804BD6765A85D85F6AD5=Cobalt, we have flagged a series of orbital cannons set into the cliffs.
43F71AD4455B3D32D9E78983BE42E3E7=Cobalt, we have hostile ‘Mechs actively advancing into the spaceport. I need to set you down earlier along the northeastern coast. Follow the coastal highway. Should eventually get you to the spaceport’s eastern gate.
C5170E6C4DE403172F025A89A562EFDE=Cobalt, we know the drill. Burn their ‘Mechs and knock out those cannons.
5CC2AAAA4B0FA40ECFAAB2B4EE9F8C2E=Cobalt, we need fire support. They are trying to encircle us!
B5A29AD64856941FAB7CB4A5F27098E4=Cobalt, we see no more ‘Mechs or armor active in the OZ.
7A2839274949B955219A3DA43F7317CB=Cobalt, weapon safety override approved. You are being deployed in a hot zone.
337CAD7941DFC4B4BACE308D5EBAE61F=Cobalt, weapons free. 
14DB7E25481E741E9AFB339452186E97=Cobalt, while the rest of the Second Jaguar Regulars will participate in this battle, you will be mounted and standing by behind the lines here. You are not to engage unless you are activated. Is that understood?
62E0E9F34E38FDA9932DFEB6FA3EE381=Cobalt, while the rest of the Second Jaguar Regulars will participate in this battle, you will be mounted and standing by behind the lines here. You are not to engage unless you are activated. Is that understood?
5D6E120E4391FCFF4D16EC845043D9ED=Cobalt, with the planetary militia refusing to stand down, one of our key targets on Courchevel is under threat.
4413A30A43479D30219B659098BED2C9=Cobalt, you have enemy reinforcements converging on your position. Ground and air elements.
F5E3A7304A89E4A05FA9DCBB04564F1A=Cobalt, you have some powerful machines ahead of you. I just ID’d them. They are not DCMS forces.
757BD68248A9E964D913C28EDDA45621=Cobalt, you heard the SaKhan. No way to avoid enemy contact, but we need to move fast. Prime your weapons.
334CF4A34FF16496DC190495AB0527CF=Cobalt, you will be dropped into the AO and investigate the suspected strongholds. Extract all intel you can find on these groups.
50796F4340334683E7CC02A214C6FA0D=Cobalt, you will bear the brunt of this responsibility. Star Colonel Wimmer is now finalizing your target path. You will move in and keep our enemy from using these bombers against us.
F0B1BDBF42BE3E467283ABB5896DA0D8=Cobalt, you will bear the brunt of this responsibility. Star Colonel Wimmer is now finalizing your target path. You will move in and keep our enemy from using these bombers against us.
596EBC5E4A7BA26D9E392E85E3249B61=Cobalt, you will go to San Tropez and demand answers of these laborers. If they resist then the whole city shall be treated as enemy combatants aiding and abetting a hostile power. Do I make myself clear?
86FF25FE43DFFDEAEBA730ADD638F233=Cobalt, you will go to San Tropez, and demand answers of these laborers. If they resist, then the whole city shall be treated as enemy combatants aiding and abetting a hostile power. Do I make myself clear?
9BE204FE4BEA6283040404B8BDD5C457=Cobalt, you will withdraw from the battle immediately and submit yourselves for arrest!
810EFCE34883AF70646A4BA41F2E922B=Cobalt, your Star will touchdown behind this ridgeline, advance on foot, and set up a firing line in this position. From there, you should be able to catch them as they attempt to ford this river.
332A3B5440DAE9D371480195729915AE=Cobalt, your star will touchdown behind this ridgeline, advance on foot, and set up a firing line in this position. From there, you should be able to catch them as they attempt to ford this river.
AACDC70842D099C01B041BBE4028A58D=Cobalt. As you know, we believe that the ISF have been coordinating the Courchevel militia's resistance to our occupation.
A9C2316E4FDC1FF2A74532A8D2A44101=Cobalt. We gave Valasek the benefit of the doubt when we challenged him to a batchall, and the rat chose to spit in our face. This dezgra action cannot go unpunished. You will show him and his kind no mercy! Clear me a path to his base, then together we will purge the pirate filth from this world.
8D4687544F4480C3E6BAA78AB7F642B0=Cobalt. With the planetary militia refusing to stand down, one of our key targets here on Courchevel is under threat.
E99C21B54B7AE2B28CEC749CEA46D5F8=Cobalt: Clan Watch has identified a high-priority target structure we must secure. I am assigning you to Delta Base. These surats are showing a penchant for razing structures to the ground to render them useless to us. Try not to join the ranks of the incompetent. I will not oversee a  Cluster that descends into Solahma warriors, so get the job done. 
2D6583F54FA9D02FFCC9688D5693DD01=Cobalt: I want to know if these coastal residents are in open defiance against us. If they are, they will come to understand the cost of helping these murderous harassers. Advance into San Tropez and demand answers from these laborers we believe are harboring the ALAG. Non-compliance will result in the whole city being treated as enemies, aiding and abetting a hostile element. It will be a cold day in Hell that I allow such inferior cowards to sully the name of Smoke Jaguar. Make them tremble!
09895BAB4C2F5E43DC4F6DB1CC7D1DCC=Cobalt: Just as I anticipated the Tenth Alshain Regulars appear to be executing a tactical withdrawal into the Dragon’s Rift Mountains. While my forces engage the bulk of their remaining units, you will serve as our rear-guard and help box them in. We have our prey right where we want them. It is time to move in for the kill. The Regulars will surrender or join the ranks of their fallen comrades. I will update you as the operation unfolds once you hit the ground. 
A95ACA89449D153B02CABFA287638C9C=Cobalt: Star Captain Adam Bes is reporting heavy resistance inside a large pocket of farmland. I dispatched Shadow Binary to find a high-ranking militia leader. I am deploying you as a response force to assist them in finding this priority target. For Kerensky’s sake, execute better than Shadow Binary. Their ineptitude is unworthy of our namesake. If there is a high-value target we can knock off and quell these pockets of resistance, we can tame this system sooner. Hit the mark and deliver Cobalt, and I will consider you for the most prestigious assignments moving forward.
884C848E4623EFBCAA2C6B95923259F9=Cobalt: Terra still awaits our arrival. In order to get there, we must capture Luthien and put these dragons down. The First and Second Sword of Light are holding the First Jaguar Guard at a standstill at the southern tip of Waseda hills. We must break the stalemate. Punch through their battle-line and blow the front wide open!
096ACF35446D51A628C4CD9D93215C89=Cobalt: When Valasek went to the ground, he took substantial supplies. Meanwhile, his pirates have taken over homesteads and are using them as makeshift outposts for their purposes. Scout the area and validate priority targets crucial to Valasek’s operation, especially munitions depots that Hawk Star can take out during an aerospace attack run. Foodstuffs and other vital supplies will be collected later to resupply the armada. It has been a grueling trek across the Exodus road so we will need as many resources as possible. Good hunting, Jaguars. 
39FDDEE14A15B38BC4F975872CC3D5C5=Cobalt: agents embedded in the local populace have received word of highly suspicious activity around a remote junkyard. There are energy signatures that do not match the primitive tech the Kuritans typically use. Investigate the energy signature and find out if they are one, or both of our wayward DropShips. 
477758014F2139EF9EA14082B0A9BEBD=Cobalt: it is time to trap our prey. We will draw the ISF out into the field. ComStar has helped us selectively leak supply and personnel transfer plans into Courchevel’s lucrative mining fields. By Kerensky's grace, the ISF will dispatch a sizeable force to try and capture our assets. When their forces walk into the teeth of our trap, you will strike them down with the crushing might that only a Smoke Jaguar can deliver.  
498A7F364D0BFF6176BAFBB707E60D77=Cobalt: the Amphigean scum are attempting to escape. The ALAG are massing up at a DropShip fueling yard on Courchevel’s second moon. I am assigning you the vanguard of this operation. Take the point and lead a strike force against these Amphigeans. 
CECF20744FC22EA7FC8475979D900CD8=Cobalt: there are human lives at stake, not to mention the ability to shine a light on where Valasek is holed up. If the remaining captives do possess intel that can direct us to his hideout these barbarians will do whatever it takes to silence them. But we cannot verify what they know until they have been extracted and are firmly in Jaguar hands. Enter the AO and validate the location of the remaining prisoners. Once you do, secure the area to facilitate their safe extraction.
A168B6AF4B923F25EB2099B092DDDC0D=Cobalt: we have identified a series of enemy homesteads based on the decrypted intel recovered from the abandoned Killers' Base. Investigate each target structure for backup data and resource stockpiles that may reveal the hole's location that coward Valasek is hiding. I want that pirate scum out in the open so he can answer for his crimes against us. Every moment Valasek remains at large is an insult against The Smoke Jaguar. We have much bigger fish to fry in the Inner Sphere so see it done. 
B9F72FB343514BC7DCCC3481679C2654=Cobalt: while we wait for the rest of the armada to return and resume this invasion it is about time you assisted Zeta Galaxy with some of their administrative duties. I am assigning you to customs and border inspection duties at the Jardin SpacePort. You are to perform routine inspections on all outbound and civilian DropShip traffic. 
E8369EA34933BD406360BFB908E7884D=Cobalt: your first assignment is upon you. Helmar Valasek has accepted our batchall. Santander's days of being a pirate's den are about to come to an end. The system's natural resources will soon be under our possession. But Santander's Killers will not just hand over this system willingly. Nor have they disclosed the number of forces they plan to employ to oppose us. Assist my Shroud Keshik as a scouting unit within the Gillard Plains and ascertain the number of forces Valasek has for this engagement. 
532B240E4287B32096E946A3FA026218=Cobalt? Status report? Did transmitting those codes work? Cobalt?
2C6BAA7F47FD406FDD0073943D7B5AC2=Cobalt’s insertion point will be here, far enough from any possible hostiles that may be in the facility.

B203C4194D52713C3DF74098A65DE220=Codenamed Blackhawk by Inner Sphere Forces, the Nova was an earlier design among the invasion rosters. Debuting in 2870, the 'Mech set many trends in OmniMech production down the road. Despite the model's age, it was still a common sight in the invasion. Boasting 12 ER Medium Lasers to light up the sky, it is no wonder how the Nova got its name. The extreme levels of firepower and no ammo requirement are enough to cut down any 'Mech of its size or smaller throughout extended engagements. These weapons also produce a debilitating amount of heat that the 'Mech struggles to manage.
B96B15C847551A54714C90A290D994D1=Codes are verified. We have our way in.
9F27FC33450BDB35CA0AD5A5FCAEDEAD=Codes seem to have… wait… we are being tight beamed a video transmission from the base?

EBC3923C40B55CD16A86ADBACBE6B7A8=Colonel Kell had nothing but positive things to say about you Jayden. With a performance like that, your future with the Dragoons is bright.
C89F4CB143F03A160BBC7688723F906F=Colonel Kell is jammed up. Get over there and assist.
9D23127A447C61D2AFE74AB86A361999=Colonel Kell, the Nova Cats have shifted away from our front and look to collapse onto yours. We are here to offer our assistance.
04F07C1941D381728CD64E8EE9824146=Colonel Wolf, It’s done. I’m ready for reassignment.
1158A29D436CF5AC50E0D79DCC9F8293=Colonel Wolf, mission accomplished. Ready for orders.

6DD5C497422A40C8DF1719896515C41D=Colonel Wolf, one of our ‘Mech's key advantages is fighting at speed. If we are not allowed to leverage that, we give the advantage to the Nova Cats.
B54536B4463B21D68B7E89B5E49425F1=Colonel Wolf, the field is clear. No further Nova Cats on the scope.
BA8A1CFB40F2A80321F2668D2403A30F=Colonel!
227A929A43E4C095980D93871E30907E=Colonel, some of us aren’t in much of a fighting shape.

29CF35F74BB874CAB2A9D79F6B6F68A0=ComStar are aware of this group, Galaxy Commander, though our information is limited.

84240EB144898540F5C78A8EB34AE424=Come on! It’s time to take the fight to the Clans! Show them what the Dragoons are made of!

We will recover them once the field is clear.

C2972DFE4AFD88F8E66181A82BEBB680=Data Caches found in this 'Mech's battle computer identify it as a long lost 'Hellslinger'. This 'Mech was specially made to compete in the Star League Martial Olympiad's Hades event. Taking place outside a terraforming dome on Venus, the special Hades event saw competitors fight each other until their 'Mech was downed or the blistering heat forced them to shutdown. While not originally a unique design, the destruction of the Venus terraforming domes in the centuries since the fall of the Star League likely makes this Hellslinger the last of its kind.

The Executioner carries a MASC, which grants it an extreme but temporary boost to mobility. When against opposing 'Mechs, the Executioner lives up to its name with incredibly precise long-range firepower. However, the Executioner does have some glaring weaknesses, such as a lack of close-range firepower and a lack of smaller backup weapons, which makes it difficult to effectively handle smaller targets.

Despite GFBM utilizing the Cicada production lines at the same Gibson facility to cut down on R&D costs, re-adapting the ancient Star League tech and the lack of capabilities to manufacture replacement components saw the project's budget spiral out of control. GFBM eventually deemed the project non-viable, and mothballed the various prototypes. Of which, The X-5 proved to be the only battle-ready chassis produced.

This mobility comes with a price; the Mist Lynx is quite frail when it finds itself pinned down.
C6B61E23463304AEA50FB29687D45444=First produced in 3010, the Adder was designed with the specific purpose of invading the Inner Sphere. Despite starting as a Clan Star Adder exclusive model, the Adder was so powerful every Clan sought it and it became a commonly used light 'Mech across all Clans. The Inner Sphere's codename for this 'Mech is Puma for its ambush potential. The Adder is a well-armored, slow combat light that is best known for its iconic Prime configuration of 2 ER PPCs, which offer it precise and devastating long-range damage potential.
60D9E7B44365CF95E9CAB4A7B3665708=First released in 2520, the Dervish was one of the first BattleMechs to be produced in abundant numbers. Its primary role is that of a long range fire support platform, and its array of secondary weapons and jump jets make it highly mobile and menacing at any range. The trade-off to all this firepower, predictably, is relatively weak armor and a cooling system incapable of keeping up with sustained fire for long.

87E2CA0E4DCE94DD3618E682924BB79C=Florentine is the evocative 'Mech of Judith Faber, known to most only by her code name Rapier. Despite piloting a 'Mech built for standard combat, Faber's role is anything but typical. As a MechWarrior, her skills are renowned, but as a covert agent, she is beyond compare. Through blurry allegiances and webs of deceit spanning a decade or more, Faber is able to come up with the answers to questions no one dared to even ask.

4F3707CF44B284112B661E9466BDCD72=Give me a sec. Transmitter’s gone, but the buoy itself is intact. They must need it themselves to navigate through this mess. I can still interface with it manually.
F2D4D3CD4B5DDA86A60F3399B744644B=Give these dezgra vermin no quarter! Exterminate all but Valasek’s Battlemaster! He is mine!

3757D83F4F8A95D02F746AB575BEBF96=I assure you it is not!
A670369C40B9E48746764E8A6173C47E=I backtracked the ISF's encrypted messages to this location. Someone is out there. And they have been broadcasting messages around the system.
7909175842B6B6DCE5F7A09FE83A2BA7=I backtracked the ISF’s encrypted messages to this location. Someone is out there and they have been broadcasting messages around the system.
6C3D8F9B4C41FAD7B89E499E422E24C3=I bet he is. He always loved those bits in The Remembrance, the accounts of heroic saviors and noble fallen warriors.
0E227438407ED2C7ECE99C8354ACE094=I brought more firepower with me.
AACB59424D6C0E1AB80731BCC291CE37=I came across your transmission by accident when I was looking for him.
E30D4CB845F33193F9727F98986CCB77=I can assure you, that is not an issue unique to the Clans.
92138511421B3107F23997B9B09C3701=I can hardly believe it... 
6ECF89834095A5275E693EB2BFB32BBD=I can only tell you what ComStar knows, Galaxy Commander. We are not all seeing, especially when it comes to planetary matters.
B75031BB49F245FCFFAE288A8C42867B=I can see that but the fact remains, he has the popular support of the commanders left garrisoning the OZ. I still do not see a way around that fact, Ez.
FF8F8A724BFF3E68B40A2782FED6F499=I can see why. None of you are insane, just brave.
44992961485B2D3D753CABBA02FCF041=I can't believe we all made it!
316CFBB24A228C3E5E78B3BA5AF2E898=I can't comply!
C0387B2A4F05E526513065A60863D053=I can't do that!
DD5B5DFC468F7997CDEC708FCC28F1AF=I can't do that.
67A786FD4C737A2AC7BD5398A8ABBF67=I can't get a clear shot!
3FD23CA34AAA39EA5B21BA8EA287DAA3=I can't get there, Star Commander.
E5F022E94E227689FE6AD0B6D57F9B88=I can't get there.
C29F040744A6E0B0C72675845CE57BC9=I can't go on! Ejecting!
2547446944F260564125B0AE960471D5=I can't move there!
B8864B434366AD23145B918B82999A82=I cannot believe how much we used to complain about the rain back then. At least we could see through it.
DB0714CA46F7F38A712A16AE997B343B=I cannot believe our march on Terra has finally begun.
D2D51C144CB94BB35135BC9FA9F1C197=I cannot believe this day is here.
6EFE03AC4E47529A517AD18E6FA89315=I cannot believe we are withdrawing.
304AEF9849F28BE65A34589244C5F71A=I cannot get there, Star Commander.
8AE9D37C41CCD2D0142C6D92E5FC542F=I cannot get there.
846FAB624E408B51F1BAB2B24C79FF1E=I cannot help but feel like command underbid on this operation.
536C493442FCBCD0B4F59EBAE3EF0329=I cannot let this drag on.
3977AAF848A0CFF868D9C9903C216CE0=I cannot see them trying to hold this place with a skeleton crew.
03D43D824D37E2755CC1AEB974D7DB4C=I cannot speak on any other Clan, but no, insanity does not drive the Jaguar. Ambition does. We revered ourselves as the strongest and most capable within the Clans and we fight fiercely to uphold that reputation.
CE3A985B4FC07D5DAB99DCA5AB6B541D=I cannot take part in another Edo.
74BD8F0B4737B25780FD93AEFC425146=I can’t guarantee anything in battle,  but I will try.
70DDED9C45EE7A2190489F97FB722F0A=I catch myself sometimes slipping into contractions as well. I think after what happened, a part of us misses his brazenness.
AD663B784A2F843BB500D8ABFCDEF693=I challenge you to a circle of equals!
C4A7BD48401DF0AD9577728EDF701B01=I challenge. Mia may stand in as my proxy.
502654144AE4EED1E21166BA05D6B929=I claim this warrior in the name of the clans. By right, he is my isorla. He will be more valuable alive than dead.
879E99AF40664E4691E7BB8C849CB03C=I claim you as bondsman in the name of...
593F4AEE4076ACBB9EF1E78C0F246C1E=I come to you today with a matter of critical importance to the Clans.
0E26D3024E1FC0109E9D7E9EFA7D5B06=I could listen to this all day.
50250A814D90CF0BC5C069B1EFD5499E=I decoded a message…
D2A261714D51054CFBFE53824FBD8AF9=I did not get a visual.
3DC7BA424EB0A4E73ECB0681E87A38E8=I did not know of your return.
2E0E8C5640F278C3D57575B486564E3C=I did what I knew was right.
B247BB824958309BCDDE60A2FFA14C76=I didn't need my right torso anyway!
90251AAB4E751915C2CE5D8D7A8CF127=I dispatched Shadow Binary, led by Star Captain Adam Bes, to verify this information and cut the head off the snake, should a target of opportunity present itself.
2DE778C54ECF4C5BC17E658EEF5C6D9B=I dispatched Shadow Binary, led by Star Captain Adam Bes, to verify this information – and cut the head off the snake, should a target of opportunity present itself.
9DDB9A954C758A7CE0C5698A35FC87A0=I dispatched advanced recon units to sweep for evac points. We have verified the ALAG is assembling en masse at a DropShip fueling yard on Courchevel’s second moon.
AAF4E5FD42D04778532A8A8E210B51B9=I dispatched advanced recon units to sweep for evac points. We have verified the ALAG is assembling en masse at a DropShip fueling yard on Courchevel’s second moon.
94CB112A44A63F8AE6AF7386A360C4B1=I do love fresh meat!
A0848BBE46B607486E06FA830956C34A=I do not care. This has become a military matter.
E6DDAAF045FA5132F2AAFDBBB30F817E=I do not envy these MechWarriors that were thrown to the front lines against us.
F923827F4192EEB5265EC5851B800459=I do not know what else I can say to you, Ez.
324E00A24CF45C94BDE446B85D0BF77A=I do not know, Galaxy Commander. As you had declared Kurushii-yama a military asset, my people did not have access to it.
4DF1194644CC3BF02824EA8C8F9F1209=I do not know, but if I had to guess, it is because of Gunji-no-Kanrei, Theodore Kurita, Takashi’s heir. He is known for his “unorthodox” reforms of the DCMS. It would not surprise me to hear that the Dragoons are here at his invitation.
8F7C518C455AB6681C5237AFB41C0011=I do not know... yet. We were not lucky enough to get a full key. But I think I might have broken enough to backtrack the message to its destination.
F6F6816848BBC76464D937ADFE486358=I do not like it, but Jayden is right. Backing down now will only embolden more towns to help the ALAG. Gerber is forcing our hand. 
BDF8E0894C3059A92CD06399A458619E=I do not like the idea of the Kuritans being able to capture our ships.
FB2864BD49560ABB0D4DA587901CC6CC=I do not like the look of that thing.
F12A30A549293B8E8EB9D28A3A4FE153=I do not like to repeat myself, Star Commander.
15F11446451CD4AD1D18A0ACC2C0235D=I do not see any reinforcements. This is the last of them.
619AA4B34BD8187D55542A8491AABF51=I do not think I can do this on my own.
49A28FFC4875F57A2F57E0B902AE3C64=I do not think these ‘Mechs are going to tire him out. His battle prowess is legendary.
E6A3D5EC4DE778EDCE5032B401B79027=I do not think this is everything. What the Luthien Defense force lacks in skill, they make up for in bodies.
4F534E2D45EB2522E69CDC80A6D99A62=I do not understand. I thought the common people would be glad to be rid of their Kuritan overlords.
5060D76B4CB120A947BE81ABF6D525C1=I do not want the ISF, the DCMS or whoever is behind this to believe they have the upper hand.
31E381FE4235DC1C51FD1BB374FC74DD=I do not want the ISF, the DCMS… or whoever is behind this… to believe they have the upper hand.
335D7D64428383C040F9668A50C2869C=I do not want to be here when those doors open. Need to fall back, and find a new vantage point.
9079B6C84B85048C1A219098570362AE=I do. Although I admit it will be difficult. Especially with the specter of Edo still hanging over us. 
5B2E4C4F44065F0F849F6EACFC7357A6=I do. You spend a decade being sidelined by your cluster, you end up mingling with a lot of merchants. I sympathize with them, much more now than I ever did in my youth.
525AE8294CB87C6FA5F71CA91D3F94E8=I don't know. ilKhan Showers promised we’d take Terra within the year. I think every Clan is pretty eager to see out his will.
7FA65E354B9867B5FFF6DCACF35999A5=I don’t have that kind of time.
ADD84106489BC43B4725BB9D0FFF78DF=I don’t think I’ve ever seen Wimmer like this.
4283FAAA41EB8EB43F16A08EBDE39FE2=I don’t think we’ll be getting a warm welcome.
67E4BA604FC7F266E5E0D69B85BD82C0=I doubt it. This place is dead.
6201BB76422F7213F16A3C89E3671E82=I doubt most citizens have ever even seen it. Another gated paradise to the exclusive benefit of the royal family.
3446E45E44E8F97DF5370C9B730F7984=I doubt rescuing Hohiro is even about the war. Given their neo-feudal dictatorship, I think this is about securing House Kurita’s future and legacy.
6A6B94214E7B79AB2BF213AE2BC807F7=I doubt they are much of a threat anymore. I guess we’ll just sit tight till relieved. 
EF0EE0EF4D49D175355C178430A902A7=I doubt they will try anything with us securing the surface. Just need to wait for the elementals now.
FD8484474187FD699942E8BFF0249ACE=I dunno. We left a lot of metal limbs in our wake. They might be slapping together more frankenmechs as we speak.
08372AA54B5075BBF9679FA30BD8027B=I earned my bloodname by killing men like him. 
AD1A488E449805D852130DA84B81115A=I even see snipers stationed on those cliffs.
EFD8E88C481B09275B2F199A68052B4B=I expected acts of terrorism when we faced off against that pirate scum, but not when we faced warriors that claimed to follow a strict code of honor. Clearly, they only wish to save themselves no matter what low they must sink to. I want this evil punished! Investigate the suspected military installations and shine a light on who is responsible. Bring me a target, Cobalt so that justice can be served and we can subdue these horrific acts! 
8626D24D4DBFC97E9419ABA3755EFC3A=I fear they will never truly accept him.
1CCDEF394DE65C3E64D9E089B7B7E153=I fight with the ferocity of my namesake to see the Great Father's dream realized.
D4F366D44947C6EEF1D4BBA3D8C8A916=I formally served with the Jaguar Grenadiers.
BB95C0DD413C003DAFC118A700732E6E=I fought Nova Cats while you kits were still learning to walk. This is nothing new to me.
DB0F4BF049C3E5E9447819A730453AA3=I found a door. It is sealed. We need to find a way through.
69F90FF14B31AE0EAF21FD8C9DE6942E=I found something, but no codes.
E5A725354EE55605BE4551ABA676F3DB=I freely admit responsibility for the 362nd 
A8665F7C4C39767D693E779CA2613F06=I get it.
00058FFD4FC72C4C47F2F19FFFE014D8=I give you a regiment of battlemechs 
4E75DE2A4E055E4F29B1F4BAFF020488=I give you a vast prize, 
FDF27A8D4B6FA9E03A2C4CB7C8101D33=I give you, Star Captain Jayden Smoke Jaguar!
89581E8E4DB9E834C8392992F3EB9FB4=I got it. Sending targeting info now.
A8B6FD734F48C03664B0E38F38D5EA01=I got multiple hostiles emerging from down below. Watch those doors.
2B16F8C443C57D11F13898AB2A3BCD1C=I got nothing!
EB10F68C48448B3426E19B9843B57219=I got something. Might be able to get those repair bays up and running. 
0583421E4C4690DA20FA1B95A52DF915=I got you, Stray.  Proceed to the marked location.
05AE3AFC4FB4CF62EC9526B570E71DEF=I grew up poor on Vega. 
4AF7E264445169BF101E7B98BF9C6538=I guess cowardice runs so deep in their blood, they are not even aware they are afflicted by it.
5FCD0C2D4AB2C66F04553AB1C41397BE=I hacked ol' One-Eye's message feed. He's still sore we've been outperforming his prized pupils.
5C2BB2C74985DA0B46E9E19EAE02C8D9=I had a choice laid before me: pull my punches and try to re-take Emil as bondsman,
68DB5BD4489D457CA7F13CA1CB06DE69=I hated the idea of losing him to the Watch at the time. But had he lived, I think he would have served them well. It was where he was meant to be. He would have been one step ahead of these surats.
81539E044AFF5EBE39C0BCB90CABFD27=I have ID'd a leopard DropShip, Cobalt. More reinforcements coming your way!
EB8635B6479A6F69834C028CC52B02EF=I have a feeling we will be seeing more as we proceed. The Ryugawa did not come this far to go out with a whimper.
8A1156C94F2E88D933959B8A1E405590=I have a hit. The data core was storing codes.
BA93A86143D7B947B7C85198DC2258EC=I have a question for any of you. Is it true that the Jaguars carry a reputation for violent insanity, even within the Clans?
8AF75AB749D409655C84CD94EC0D57C3=I have a visual on hostiles emerging from the mouth of a cave.
D545D4DD4FBEE31EB0BADF972ABE0193=I have a visual on the Leopard.

AB058B0242EEE3C574E0F1B158CCD2F1=I have already dispatched MechWarriors Fowler and Orydzuk from Granite Star to scout the largely rural area you will be landing in.
556FEF3148F0589E901F23BBE5947099=I have attempted to chip away at the encryption to see what the data packs contain.

42EF3B4D466E74E79879CE82CE3DA096=I have chosen the Dragon’s Rift Mountains to be our battleground.

4DCD167F4A6F7939F3177BAB9FCDABAF=I have heard that the other Clans are dealing with mercenaries. Apparently, loyalty is not good enough. These so-called warriors want for money too.
073D3F8442B24AFAEFE298A5882C92A2=I have looked through ComStar’s previous tactical maps of Edo, and referenced them against the latest orbital recon conducted across the region. I have uncovered a large change in activity in an unoccupied valley.

73141CA74236CCA72087CDAEF57AED0A=I have marked your position on the line, Dragoons. Move to it and hold fast. Air assets are still mobilizing.
91A663B5450D26EB489754812B691DBD=I have no love for Perez or what he is doing here in the OZ.
E4DA1F604539C3758E115885F10278A9=I have no reason to hide! The Combine has received information that you’re illegally housing stolen SLDF ‘Mechs and weapons! By order of Coordinator Yoguchi Kurita, you will open these gates and surrender all of your ‘Mechs and SLDF equipment to the Draconis Combine! This is your final warning!
0AB558024E54071BF59BED9F17815EAA=I have no visibility. This damn storm…
D75936ED43B344D26ABCCE9F0AE6FFD9=I have not seen this logo since we left. What is with these five stars?
A3AC35E242921494730C40B9F051F4F9=I have nothing to add to that Cobalt. Just get it done!

BCE57639473E8A2068DCE4B4B061D4F1=I hear you, but the Ryugawa have become too comfortable conducting guerilla attacks against us. Besides, these are military assets. They are fair game.

CB8ECE5E4C8EC25DC4258B8DEA9D596D=I highly doubt it. The Luthien LAW factories are the beating heart of the Combine’s ‘Mech production. Everything within these facilities is classified as Combine state secrets. Takashi Kurita would never allow outsiders to step foot in this facility, especially those who he has an outstanding blood feud with.
29AD371E449A3C2684054E8742E5430A=I hope I am here to see it... the fall of this corrupt regime!
960A55B74016EA20DA0E99B58FDFE65B=I hope for the former. We did not gear up for nothing.

69AE402F4A4ED7ED4DCBFC81F1CE7892=I hope you know that your little stunt on Courchevel lost us that world. I will get you back for that embarrassment!

0592B713492E253ABF120CBFACC569EC=I invited you and your fellow sibkin here, because I was told by Kit Commander Ismiril,
1A5DB0E34CD48C4D4EC020A1C97A6583=I issued a batchall to the commander of the 14th Legion of Vega, Tarukito Niiro. He declared he would face us down with every ‘Mech under his command.

A1A829204C304307B8915C9E8570D6C1=I knew this was a trap!
28CD5516402907ACE9DB4BB7BA5D0954=I know everyone is nervous, but we should get to the Proving Grounds ASAP. I am not in the mood to incur a Kit Commander's wrath when we have yet to even see our bunks.
BEF1C3514EA4DA5C242B38BE86F156F1=I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but what you did here saved lives. This world and the Combine people are in your debt. This is what it is to be a Dragoon. 
296791784FFEA2A8B3041ABD13D7D870=I know it is not the Clan way, but if we focus fire and bring them down quickly, we can turn the tide!
000993304E12E3EAAFB295A7FCE8ADE2=I know many of you have further questions, but they will have to wait. We have other important matters at hand.
E7AE3988470742CEA50EAB84282A30A2=I know many of you have further questions… But they will have to wait. We have other important matters at hand.

6BC2C8B84C47C63CCB00EB93F836630E=I know you are smarter than this.
0D00A40E487BF6AD444812B9AD039BCA=I know you talk the way you do cause you want to get under people's skin.
274C7A2C48DE170B93598480E6B1BA84=I know your star has suffered a significant blow. But nobody makes it through unscathed during bloody conflicts. MechWarrior Liam sacrificed his life for the cause.

D687696B4FC50F5C66C24DB64E099AA8=I know. I am sorry Colonel Wolf. But this is personal. I need to see this through. If there is any chance that I can claim Mia as bondsman, I need to take it.
806B12DC4ED9B0DAA2303C93E2A3010D=I know. In and out. I promise.
3A7474184A843607531596959F3BB05A=I know. They lied to me too.

A16CDFFB460319B3A9FAAB9848089BC9=I like it. If we fall, we fall as every child of Kerensky dreams… In glorious battle.

D53D49E741704AC1945FEFB0A2307B6A=I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize the monster staring back.
E2EF123D48774D634A25E986A536D5C2=I lost a component!
9D9A2A724DA51B36D3AA4287C0DFA7B4=I may not see a way out of this.
116529EB470235E7F70DD9B3D10F434F=I mean, do you think he is serious about this being it? Either become a MechWarrior or die here?
02764AF14930D20A162F01A11BCA097D=I mean, it is what all of us aspire to as warriors, is it not?

8D270CD246C940F8A56944AC2C176E87=I need no help to take you down! I embody the spirit of Smoke Jaguar, of the Great Father! You are but prey to me, nothing more!
F227317F4AB86A96BF9A9D8B7AC7C739=I need some time alone.
A67B8DDC4AB9F12DCE7835A6E233BDCF=I need to finish this or Ezra’s betrayal will continue to dishonor not just my star, but all the 362nd.
8EBCFE734A915F4C09F115AD7FE9FB78=I need to finish this. Or Ezra’s betrayal will continue to dishonor not just my Star, but all the 362nd…
B4448CB1483D0B73727DECB59FAE9F0D=I need you elsewhere, so advance to the extraction zone. Shadow Binary can clean up after themselves.
09C559EB40B0B5DF3D9847A0EA3B2E86=I needed to step up and decide what kind of future I wanted to fight for.
85C9492D451313B6C0D3DE9085B1BEB4=I never thought he would betray us.
EDA3AB254A93D7B49206478C3B893311=I never thought of that. It feels like only yesterday that my own star accepted our ransom.

A3582C684E72D42338D7FE90F0A7CB79=I only keep up because we work together as a team.

44B494F74741FD081A9E599D0340D5D2=I see the gate, but we will not be able to just walk through. Need to find a way to breach it.

35FD99F443298BFB144BB89F09237610=I should be able to get in quiet through those rocks.
3EC173FD4D525BA96D9D03A5EAA929A7=I should not have to remind anyone here, that ensuring Hohiro Kurita does not escape this system is paramount, not just to Beta Galaxy, but the entire Clan.
31102EDF4B357D7320B91DA5B2747336=I should not have to remind anyone here, that ensuring Hohiro Kurita does not escape this system is paramount, not just to Beta Galaxy, but the entire Clan. 
E35C7D53446CFE67BD2F6B9AB5D4AE80=I still cannot believe they threw a DropShip at us. I thought the spheroids treated them as too rare to risk in battle?

22D298C1492A586F1A530C9BF3B96825=I think so. I am using Liam’s scrubbing programs. These ‘Mechs, they have similar encoding to our mystery ‘Mechs from Jardin.

58FF3B6343CA0D4A6FA38F993FB444BF=I think that is it for in here.

61050EB448CDB3A5602BFE8345E1F516=I think that was the last of them. Get a move on it. We have spent more than enough time down here.
271251B74E979CB111E392B9A4D1CC84=I think that’s it for the ground forces.
EF5E5E6B483F5B8AD74A1E9E6A7957D4=I think they know they are in a fight now.

92D3B43C47684F86D3DE0291A2561B06=I thought that they were supposed to be in retreat!
41CB6CC54999A01161F2EF886781211E=I thought the Combine forbade the use of mercenaries after what happened with the Wolf’s Dragoons.

6D538CE740E7E77A3710C8BEC53680DF=I tried! I gave Gerber the opportunity to come out here and face us honorably, and he spat in our face! If I back down now, we will all be branded cowards. The damn surat backed us all into a corner.
7F5CBBE34341E7610B86D3AFF8203041=I trust everyone is as battle-ready as possible, because this battle is ready for us.
5C80855349CEDFAE465115915FBFBAE0=I trust everyone is as battle-ready as possible. Because this battle is ready for us.

0F71DFB844A714879434C9BBE200D8C1=I want these mystery raiders unmasked! Investigate the Ant Hill. Find any data to help infiltrate the facility to discover who is behind this campaign against us. We are Smoke Jaguar! If we allow ourselves to be attacked by average surats with impunity, we will strike no fear into our enemy, and the other Clans will believe they can feast on us. Find out who these cowards are so we can make them pay!

1009229444B8EF8FA79A2587DD6C1610=I want to do great things on my own terms. Not chasing down the ghost of a man I've never known.
28FC36A44B95B3200F650D93D941CCD9=I was afraid of that. Doesn’t seem fair.
19C87BCF4076B483E2E3B9B642E1FDC8=I was born in the Inner Sphere, but still taught in the ways of the clan by those like Natasha.
00E01C3C46A321E5F6CD5994E97B1FAE=I was forced to choose between what was good for me, and what was good for the Clan. 
1D7A5EE44E6B585EF26986B8057F9FD6=I was going to ask you. Why is Perez here micromanaging us on a routine inspection?

AB312144413116A5C8CEAF8E01265D0B=I was there to see them do the same thing on Vega. They do not care about any of these people. They are just tools to further their own ends.

0F6FA3914BF7A7551B1FE38992191AEF=Irrelevant, Star Colonel.
53D6AEA14AB529B91F739081ECF602C9=Irrelevant. The Jaguars value results, and those that can know their own limits. Shadow Binary thought themselves above their opponents and now will carry that mistake with them wherever they go. We should never fall to complacency, regardless of how inferior we think the enemy is, or we risk a similar fate.
761710B14C780E32679D13A1B1B18C4C=Is Valasek with them?
7E4EFA684AD646D192B21BAE5B44DEE5=Is anyone reading us? This is Star Commander Travers.
3C3828CC42B28C44CEA9E1876E589FBA=Is everything ok?
E19069684B362EE089DE01AFF2D126BD=Is he KIA?
EC32167042479B797C8CD98DBAD2BC7B=Is it over? Are we finished?
8C66DDAC44B4BA7038DF54B3D479308F=Is one of them Valasek?
10928D7E494F42823D6D5E80294903A8=Is that a trick question? Our original sibko started almost a hundred strong. You do the math.
2A2E4DA04A77C4C0B7D34EB482C236EF=Is that admiration I hear?
A93E7DA746BA5A93DB7A2C924E3908A5=Is that is an accurate assessment?
E920DB464262BE69F5A8C28641A7E71E=Is that it?
F9C6D2B148E75D984F722F96A83440BE=Is that it?
7EB86CBF44040A5746AA459DDEE3C326=Is that it? Is there nothing we can do?
6F50AACB4B901F04CF55A2A94A22F922=Is that it? The Gunship is withdrawing?
8C5C9AF84803BF9B15120EA53853D977=Is that not what caused the Dragoon feud with Takashi? One of his Warlords trying to coerce you into the DCMS like the mercs in the ALAG regiments?
2FE0440B46564E961683528DFB233635=Is that so? Well then, Kit Jayden. It seems like you have volunteered to take on the role of Star Commander for this exercise.
550808644FC0DDEC2CCDD787981F6617=Is that what we stand for? Looking for any reason to fight?
1E4F670645FA37DB60D348AD98FAF5E6=Is that… Shit! VTOL, through that hole! Careful, Cobalt! They are going to rain down hell!
31D8BD6B480F7459583E8F9AD3E68751=Is there anything particular of note we should be aware of, Star Colonel?
861F5E1E4B5F37819AF198B064DF072F=Is there anything particular of note we should be aware of, Star Colonel?
573870E1442B7A5491E5ACBEE1D07142=Is this the defense they’ve put together? Seems light.
2F09692D488158292531EC9F3716503B=Ishigaki Coastline
3FFDAE7F4A371C20F49F9EB2AD2EE369=Ishigaki Coastline
668EF3374D51214D1DB2158D866B8C29=Issue 100 commands in the Battle Grid.
04655BB243DD993DF70A72AD4F027259=Issuing a Starmate to advance will see them break formation and advance toward the ordered location, attacking any hostile along the way. Once they arrive at the designated position, they will enter a “guarded” stance, where they will stay in the vicinity of the ordered location, attacking any hostiles that enter their weapon’s range. They will remain in the “guarded” stance until given a new order. Use this order to establish support or sniper fire locations overlooking the battlefield.
5D052FCB49AD25A6B5CC65896CB0E710=Issuing a follow command will return the ordered Starmate to a “follow” state, returning them to their default behavior.
0579B98E4F9B047BAB14809BB6A48D6E=It appears heavy assets were transported into a specific area.
E14F598E40D300C0D66035990EFF662D=It appears heavy assets were transported into a specific area.
3006A9E746017053B9B732804C38DC11=It appears the bases are no longer abandoned.
D62294F34DDCB7B8D352F9A61CEF9A15=It appears the bulk of the Regular's remaining forces are proceeding right into the mouth of our trap; my Command Trinary will be waiting to greet them.
3E16FFAA479DDA9ADDED07991C88CE99=It appears the bulk of the Regulars' remaining forces are proceeding right into the mouth of our trap. My Command Trinary will be waiting to greet them.
CAB2F33F416860A20486A1A37B57170F=It appears we have squeezed this area for all we can. Now wipe out their remaining forces!
451E261642D881F1AC3D8EA3D2DAB077=It does not matter how we face her, only that we win, Ez. You need to be ready.
C49486564591A8AAA0F346980F7B4E5D=It does not work like that, Demi-Precentor.
7A20817F4BFF846E5079BD99A1A61DE7=It does sort of feel like anything might be waiting for us, just out of sight.
AA18876C43DF4F9E981CE09440A99B44=It falls to us, the only ones strong enough to tear down these corrupt systems.
1828075E4A87362A9D317B802638655C=It feels like we are being led into the teeth of a trap.
D66A031841A0AC238E9B5DBBD0EBAE7D=It feels strange fighting against our own insignia.
E94E04994BCE7FFC897AFC963C5C1D19=It has been a long road but taking Luthien should hopefully take the fight out of the rest of the Combine. It will allow us to rest and recharge in time for our inevitable arrival on Terra!
6F5473E04370F31CC211B0B1E5F21FB4=It has strong armor. Need to choose shots well to bring it down.
83DFD1C144822FA156AF4DADB0EAFB67=It is a great honor to fight at the saKhan’s side. I cannot wait to see her in action again.
8316FF3B489CC32C054134B8BF334EDC=It is a monument to the Kuritan war machine. Soon it will be ours and serve a much nobler cause.
476800E04FB6B29AC31CACA225FDA253=It is a question that Clan Smoke Jaguar instilled in all of us from a very young age.
9844B3F74F63B9E0106ADAA40C73574B=It is a shame it will be the backdrop for what we must do.
5EF91D314AAF884618AD2381A7FC3FC1=It is about proving to the Jaguar, 
9F69C43B466CC96F9A66F9BB400D2093=It is about time you decided to engage us in honorable combat.
270D8D3043F5CF2D3B86D99E21C655C9=It is about time.
C6F97BA24581598C431571B1ADD4ED20=It is almost time... Are you ready?
257EE46848020E7F0DADB3998272FEB0=It is an encrypted file alright.
E657CFAB4B5244048AF1D68A071648A8=It is as if they do not see our superiority. We are saving them from themselves.
174CD03C4A1E42E5D8B7F08BC65CB9D6=It is clear the samurai of the Draconis Combine are no different than Valasek and his band of pirates - spineless barbarians, but now fighting under a different banner.
6FD5B64B4051BB0BACA289BF1BC30BC7=It is clear the samurai of the Draconis Combine are no different than Valasek and his band of pirates; spineless barbarians, but now fighting under a different banner.
7D03A5334E72F1AF98233BAF1F9871EF=It is difficult to fathom the depths to which these freebirths will stoop, but this has given us a taste.
E107505F4AFC31E13C3782AB268028FB=It is difficult to fathom the depths to which these freebirths will stoop, but this has given us a taste.
87A5A94A4DF1D7AC86EE75BD3389A7FE=It is done. Gazelle secured.
1EB95D5B4EBC7D72377ED596A658A74A=It is down to you, Cobalt!
681CFA3C4DFDDB8F7081B68CA6A76BB4=It is eerily quiet. So many warriors outside and no one in here.
239F2DBC4F3B92FDCB9C4B92C4446B6C=It is likely that the ISF lay dormant, waiting for us to let our guard down.
8642F343426DAC0F1B3E43B081E1D1C2=It is my duty.
8AC6B8004A2B79CF046B57BDBD982024=It is my duty.
45A2662242C868306443F890D26F84B3=It is my sole purpose!
D611BAD64559A3725B2E94A114A609F8=It is not our fault that the Amphigeans are hiding in them. Their actions are forcing us to do this!
2369C8AB4800E207A180709584020557=It is not over until every one of those Jaguars are off the board! Finish strong!
99A28E9C469F52E468B248866FA726FD=It is not too late! Surrender yourselves, and the Jaguar may show you mercy!
01E3A0DC42320B425D6D6CA8944CE246=It is not well defended either, just a few turrets.
59BCD2254FE56FE7F344BC9E863BFE98=It is now, once again, up to the warrior caste to clean up their mess.
D6B74C8C4860C93B7E1F69802558C5B0=It is now, once again, up to the warrior caste to clean up their mess.
EA82BF9E4FA7477FC3B5BA9B2648A68D=It is only a matter of time before they bring their greed and their never-ending wars to our doorsteps!
9681327146762161DDF2FF97D7162354=It is only a small measure of what he deserves for Edo, but it will have to do.
3BF47D1446CC9CACF387FBAE178AB438=It is our belief that Valasek is using the reactors to power his secret encampment in the mountains.
E8E2CB424F825A755E6695900AE20645=It is our belief that Valasek is using the reactors to power his secret encampment in the mountains.
89DB6A37448870C63FAD1287C818A092=It is our sole purpose.
8F5DA47A4BFC0E2BA156D281A8270F67=It is our sole purpose.
97C801054C6C086E6010FD965CA523A0=It is quite beautiful here and we are turning it all into a smoking wreck.
EFCDB9CA44FE77E6C40DA2B62345EA89=It is rare to see a Clan MechWarrior reach the age of Ibrahim. Most seek a glorious death in place of becoming old and feeble. Ibrahim wears the scars of battle as his badges of honour. He has seen many young kits come and go. Resenting every one of them as they begin their journey into a life he once had and can now never return to. 
67C2C5DC4E26302BAA9790B3B0E4E608=It is refreshing to fight people who do not resort to dirty tricks.
383F26C649B4A882ADE480A13456E4AD=It is still a massive structure, able to take some serious punishment.
4BE92E6C4FF5F29340C4168E93404CE1=It is still strange to talk about the “Jaguars” like that.
2BD4DE71443F23F51FB73B9FE249AB1F=It is strange. The DCMS has never been known for its subtlety. Infiltration raids such as this one are not something typically studied in their military doctrine.
E0EC25924126430A4654008EF3F5103E=It is time for us to move on.
B0CB13BE495EC0CD55A8D6B10710C452=It is time for us to put Perez’s acts behind us and look ever forward to the Smoke Jaguar’s eventual victory.
1B98845C4E3F3D4948D59DABA2F6381C=It is time for us to put the Perez’s acts behind us and look ever forward to the Smoke Jaguar’s eventual victory.
ED8D034D4A7843115F361BB0AF74DDF7=It is time to advance into downtown and reinforce our claim of this place, by any means necessary.
D47193414E73067E2FCD19ABDD7C0D79=It is time to begin washing the stain Perez left on us after his actions on Edo. The 362nd has won the bid to capture Courchevel, and it begins now. The Tenth Alshain Regulars have accepted our batchall on the Harcourt Plains. Advance into the AO and engage them. Waste no time in showing them that their resistance is futile and that their only path to survival is surrender. We are The Smoke Jaguar, and we will claim Courchevel and redeem our reputation.
E3FEA8594A3CF70F6C63FC9C82CFA9AA=It is time to finish them off, make sure the people we lost is not for nothing!
6336669A46EB2C26FD8789B3DCA1D0BD=It is time to put your skills to the ultimate test and prove if you have what it takes to be the best among Smoke Jaguar. Survive in endless combat.
6A86F99D42DEB9D0C5996D850BAB3E21=It is time to put your skills to the ultimate test and prove if you have what it takes to be the best among Smoke Jaguar. Survive in endless combat.
8B0637BC459089112659B9BDD6BB98C7=It is time to put your skills to the ultimate test and prove if you have what it takes to be the best among Smoke Jaguar. Survive in endless combat.
FB0AE1B041D8C0075AECA3A19C5173C5=It is time to put your skills to the ultimate test and prove if you have what it takes to be the best among Smoke Jaguar. Survive in endless combat.
06FD207C45991B5001BF9F938D3F4258=It is time to put your skills to the ultimate test and prove if you have what it takes to join the ranks of Smoke Jaguar. You must enter the proving grounds and overcome a series of arduous trials, including besting a rival sibkin, to earn a trial of position. Your journey begins now, MechWarriors.
BAF9204941837822F7C70486D5779EAE=It is time we finished this. 
12F70D2A46EEFBC6E83EB6BC75FE58AE=It is time we finished this…
FC21B1394B96E96020D7379903EE3C4D=It is time you realize that. 
BF82652B46BA590C370D5498DF7C5B6B=It is too late! Ignition sequence has begun! Get out of there!
DF872FD749D0403886C606A2584BCC23=It is true. Multiple outfits with government backroom deals and hidden agendas. You are just begging for trouble. 
96C751BE4FE38DEB13E210AF07F18ABA=It is unknown exactly how Marcus Kurita got his hands on a prototype of the 'Mech design that would come to be known as the Hatamoto-Chi, but it is suspected that agents sympathetic to his causes managed to make it disappear from a Luthien Armor Works test facility. When the Warlord went rogue, and was declared ronin, after the founding of the Free Rasalhague Republic in 3034, he did not have long to use his Hatamoto, which he named 'Onimaru', before his death at the hands of a Lyran Loki operative. Upon Marcus' death, the 'Mech was passed on to his eldest son, Alexander Kurita.
27E9116F4F2CA37395063A9433D753F0=It is what they deserve for turning their backs on the Clans.
2332B4F849EC2BAD89E961BEB3BA0EBB=It is why we are willing to fight for our adoptive home, and take up arms against our former kin.
A538429D49F474C81DD235990E2373A6=It is. The entire Combine has been saved from collapse. The people of this planet will once again wake up free. It’s not much, but for now it will have to be enough.
C2FECBE54BF426E3E5899AA4471D8F1C=It isn’t over yet. His friends are still on the field. Let’s mop them up.
B1A682754F9324C5A2A5B0B9C37A5F34=It likely is. But that is not stopping Valasek from using them as human shields.
5E27D0C94852F60BB588E9B629E388DD=It lives in all of you, born from blood and steel,
E79D41FE439A4E6DA8FFD78B84A64B94=It looks like there are generators connected to the door. Knocking them out should get us through.
188D7E054E0C9FA31146FF88101CDCDD=It looks like you're following in your parents' footsteps. You really outdid yourself.
BD8228AE4A9FB641D6900F96C6E2BCC7=It makes sense. The bombers must have felt like their last hope, even if they are misguided there.
8DFB0174401486AD8476A9B963BAD2E1=It matters because ComStar are now our allies, feeding us information.
0146DDCA462B0F66B79B489888E63E62=It may not be a fair fight, but it is a fight nonetheless.
F523997D4C3B17AD56B9FAA9628D6BCD=It never has.
395DAABB4D6D5FA942DCC795B319E741=It stands to reason that the Ryugawa have been utilizing it. Given the relative seclusion and military assets there, it may even be their primary base of operations.
5085D20047BBCEFB8A37E8A7C6C90946=It stands to reason that the Ryugawa have been utilizing it. Given the relative seclusion and military assets there, it may even be their primary base of operations.
02CBAF1F497F68C9070CD2A2D6CDD1AD=It took them centuries to graft a stick onto a ‘Mech? How bad have things gotten out here?
499821F2491F763EDD4739980C81584F=It was Liam.
C10FC6A94EDDBB3C5E917086BEAE6C8D=It was a diversion. The Union stood down when our Aerospace fighters approached it. Only a skeleton crew on board. No Valasek.
E9B8AA314B4B05887D5C1D85986AA4DB=It was a trap Star Colonel! 
8F9413324E42BEA2D33EDEAC8754985F=It was laughable that a man who had devoted himself to peace could have perpetrated such a heinous act. Now that the true masterminds have been illuminated, we need a full report on these Ryugawa and how to crush them.

7B0CC4234A79B876BB99CD939936791F=It was, and not the first time the House Lords have tried. But since Misery, we now have a world to ourselves. On Outreach, no one is our master. And in this universe, that kind of freedom is worth fighting for.
DAB51A4E452041CCC3A5749120DE21FC=It will be a lot easier for Yuichi to get through to them if we cut off their arms suppliers. 
377D975F424324FC32786DA72A14F171=It will be a race to claim the honor of bringing an end to House Kurita’s reign. I doubt we will see much coordination between the Clans.
8D31CA5F48D93C531E39E58D1A7B4543=It will be done, Galaxy Commander.
21D429D541EDB55A7268368CD9AA3E8B=It will be done, Star Colonel.
D64E6546437955684811E0B1760F8CD0=It will be done, Star Colonel.
ED01954C4CC9A5D33862B1AFA4ED6913=It will be done, Star Colonel.

F110489C49C829F704AAA79E5146A768=It will be done, Star Colonel.
2D46F6E54AB19138680F879AA2358CFD=It will be done.

D32C55954260DE34B22B7EADDC2F3191=It will fall to those sharp enough to earn their place among our Clan's warriors.
5CE7A23D4511084CCE4AFFAB76FA2FBD=It will get better once we have driven the Tenth out. We just need a win.
2EC58B784B59F084DF12AB9AF0767B75=It will go down as a tactical error 
5FA222EC4186CD629C1C1ABD8ACE6E83=It will have to wait…
A86D8E324125390285AFC3A2A7B2E815=It will not get far. Scrambling Aerospace fighters now. Cobalt, focus on the ground forces. One of them may have a key to the front gate.
FA25F70F424BA48B6960C7A47F94AE51=It will not matter. All of them, the Jaguars, will be dying to claw out a piece of our flesh.
06AE1C1D4D59AF05B38FB88EBBB74925=It will not.
953E989348EABE22101B47BA8AC1C392=It will take a few minutes for their systems to boot up. Make the most of your time before that ship becomes active.
A09167824334C19AAB9F1A89A410A282=It won’t matter. Our codices will still be stained by Edo for the rest of our careers.
EF1062C24E060BDCE321579B9E4B96CE=It's a shame those pour souls that took refuge here paid for that with their lives.
2AEA50C249E5EAEF89CDABBBB109C153=It's a trap! They have this thing pre-sighted for artillery!
44610D3646869DF0906F97B1989EAFC6=It's time to move past our long history of animosity and band together in unity.
2B7F7F47440555298B30E4A896F50873=Its current rulers, Santander’s Killers, are led by Helmar Valasek, a self-styled pirate king. He has accepted our batchall to fight for control of this world.
55D2B65A4929302CAA5D82A72236C6F9=Its current rulers, Santander’s Killers, are led by Helmar Valasek, a self-styled pirate king. He has accepted our batchall to fight for control of this world.
24B70C104791F4F66A0692956A870F40=Its purpose? Its purpose has always been to bring vengeance down on all the despot House Lords that destroyed the Star League and enslaved humanity! And all I see, is a star of traitors that dare stand in the way of the Jaguars' birthright!
C2E6B09C4DF1A65BAF016F851E86EEEB=It’ll take time to get used to. Just as long as you know that they are the enemy.
B2B86481497AF4279A8AED9D311075AD=It’s a frankenmech.
58AF80E74189F889521A399701DACFBD=It’s about time! Give 'em hell!
8186FE9A4E43DC362FA6AAB57D60093C=It’s been nearly fifty years since the Dragoons were created...  That would mean...
EA62FB2D4B67AD2EE55544A08F5E3758=It’s gone quiet. I think we’re clear.
8E0480C545F149241EB795BB03B3A403=It’s gone. It’s all been destroyed.
11C740004AA7933F8935FC9644E39560=It’s gonna be tough to get through that door without the rest of the code.
B329C99C45162B6C89FDA598A9FB6790=It’s gonna take a few minutes to work its magic.
E68DC99045E251179D7B40A8517A0749=It’s good to be back out on the field again.
78965D964814AAD73571449E628FA7B8=It’s kind of spooky here, right?
3D5A3A7A4EADB70C16B511BEEE15B46D=It’s not just him. I’ve lapsed into it, as well. I like to think it keeps a part of here, with us.
5F9BE35C46241A6B1D315DB1530AB2B8=It’s reductive thinking like that that drove Perez to genocide! The Jaguar is complicit in the events that lead to the destruction of Edo!
98D48193455CAD41C0D70DAAC2AF25DA=It’s time to do what we came for. No matter what happens, leave her to me.
32F60EED4B548B7DC360478447605F0A=It’s true.  Even with the Dragoons manufacturing clan-grade tech, we cannot outfit the entire unit with it. But trust me, our MechWarriors more than make up for the tech difference with grit and tenacity.
A9A2BE784D233AE0534CF59F7FAD5738=Ivo was just a skinny teen when he briefly appeared on holovid screens across the inner sphere in his fathers documentary series 'Greenburg's Godzillas'. Now, several years later he's serving as a MechWarrior in the unit still helmed by his father. Despite the show's cancellation, the Greenburgs have obviously done well for themselves, as most fresh MechWarriors tend not to serve in green scaled King Crab.
11BDCB064B1BC89A24CE02916972250A=Ivy Upsalom leads Upsalom's Support Lance, a unit of Redjack Ryan's pirate 'Mech force. Known to monitor enemy tactical frequencies in the hopes of discerning any female MechWarriors and challenging them to personal combat in her Quickdraw. Her claim to the best woman MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere is still undisputed as Upsalom's 30 combat kills attest, also earning her the moniker 'Ladykiller'.
401C4B864FBC0107BA611B84FE840627=I’ll bet my ‘Mech’s left arm they’ll hit us with an ambush.
352BE3EE431840419FE5429BEA6FF642=I’ll explain later if this works. For now, just trust me.
ADD4EE6B462C2DD2AB8C32BC23F9AEC5=I’m glad to be out of that storm for a while.

E5FA6143415E765720E7F7B8EAF77A6E=I’m now recording and broadcasting this conversation across all frequencies. You will NOT be able to hide what you are doing here!

43945A594AA0A463579811B9A3E12C2F=I’ve taken the liberty to mark a nav route to one such DropShip. Exit through that gate and drive all Clan forces back!
5AA339C64A23AC0264BFCDA1C8057EC3=I… I can’t believe it!
6BC6214B4AF4C9D70389C08521EED0AB=I… I don’t know. All that anger… all that rage… I thought I would be satisfied with clearing our names but this doesn’t feel like a win. It just feels empty.

88DFAF6B4F56015CA8332794D5035649=Jayden, I am running out of time. I need to tell you…
30A9FF84493E983CF12D4ABE6C46CF40=Jayden, I knew you were naïve, but never delusional. Please, come back to me before you do something you cannot take back!
0F7A2F8444EA1BD40DCACABE220A1F6E=Jayden, I know that saKhan Weaver has tasked you with hunting Ezra down, but the timing of this trial is less than ideal.
635012CA4C1472FC6D801DA6B2DFC3EB=Jayden, I know you Jaguars like to get scrappy, but resist the urge to stray from your post.
E196F0C5446952A3CEF64F89A2B8F438=Jayden, I love you both. 
4DE7E6E142C7D60D7EDB34A2E3E566DD=Jayden, Mia, Goodbye. 
DE2BFC1D4EEC70A450CBC39B6B678BAC=Jayden, Middleton, we can manage here for the time being. I want your Star to head to the Kell hound front and reinforce their position.
F07105764F94C51078B2AC80FDF1C12B=Jayden, are you ok?
7C71D6DF4C3542D84964B68099AFCF6D=Jayden, focus! We have no time for her.
159ECE37417AC8CCDF93B2809E3B2391=Jayden, get your ass in gear, or I will strip you of your command!
3CC5E7CE4A2F04790C25EEA43802DAD3=Jayden, he is getting worse.
EA4441DE45196E5425FCA185A0CD97D8=Jayden, hostile DropShip inbound.

0C9C64F640EFD3E53E635D8B94D04957=Jayden, is this channel private?
9748D8864CC146B26D56E2AE1AEE22BC=Jayden, it was bondsref, her choice. There was nothing you could do.
906C103F463B1EF1C7995B960E8B4204=Jayden, keep them off me while I work.
E850F4BB4C9DCB72FE1DD6ABA0E49A5D=Jayden, my ‘Mech’s in bad shape. Help me out here.
BD7AE3904AF69834512B8B826F124539=Jayden, switch comms over to private for us.
5D648FE649EAB47C01A5C8A32B47E3BA=Jayden, the Nova Cats have fallen back to regroup, but there is no telling for how long. Your Star has done more than enough here. I’m cycling you out. Get back to base and get some R&R. We’ll need you back on the front soon enough.
D54E907E4ACB4F1118926581940A8F05=Jayden, this invasion will forever define the Clans, and I do not intend to be left behind.
20CA88D0490E1C6FB6E3BFB48678636E=Jayden, watch those doors. We got hostiles coming from down below.
BE12AA274765ED6EF4520F9A3DC6A50D=Jayden, we cannot leave Liam!
3CB7E1544A0DB3AA44F95EBCBA6B93C0=Jayden, we need to talk in person. Seek me out after the debrief.
1CE8F3CC41FADA29509825B5FAFAC08B=Jayden, what are you thinking? You know we have a war to win, right?
A49B871D4C03D337F64F11BD030CE359=Jayden, whatever happens, just remember: we were loyal. We kept the faith in Smoke Jaguar. That truth alone might be the only thing that saves us now.
502EE3E6408CBB857320C4B59CBFD2AA=Jayden, where are you?
98B66FB9418505237E77F6897D8654D0=Jayden, you asked me to find another way. This is the only way! We need to go! It is now or never!
9A5DAC6544EB32BF269182854365C6DF=Jayden, you coming?
AE7A50A5423831EE704D61B8CD11B3C0=Jayden, you have to know if there was any other way, I would have taken it.
F73E3E844B6C442D240E259BA7E27FFD=Jayden. You have FAILED your qualifications for MechWarrior! Standby for recovery and reassignment...laborer.

2674CED348CD42AF61DEC286486F004B=Jayden... Mia…
B5AEBCE34C710E2C371A64ABE014F9BC=Jayden... is fine when we are off duty.
A3167E5F4B2903C061A209B7C46EADCF=Jayden: Smoke Jaguars managed to break through the DCMS lines and have their sights set on the primary base of The First Sword of Light on the doorsteps of the Imperial City. Reach the base and defend it at all costs. You are about to face your former allies. Here on Luthien is where your past, present, and future collide. Ensure you are ready before you deploy because this battle will be unlike any other test you have faced.
0C66C81C4DCDEA295B39EE9E2D30C726=Jayden: despite the set-backs that lost us this world, your star performed well and carried out its duty in true Smoke Jaguar fashion. The great father would be proud. Now come. Terra still awaits us! 
073C048C4BB78C7E35DA078BB5970E6F=Jayden: your Star is on its own on this one. Advance into the Imperial City and face the trials before you. Take your former ally as a bondsman if possible, and try not to get killed. We have invested a lot in you. May Kerensky guide you to victory.

Allowing for pathways & sight lines wide & clear enough for mechs (which range in height from 8-20m) to navigate; and simultaneously convey a sense of environmental density, posed a big challenge for art direction.

Witnesses would also claim Number Seven would repeatedly take shots that would take down an Atlas only to walk it off as if nothing happened. Ford's luck eventually ran out when a failed Death From Above attempt saw Number Seven's gyro shatter causing the 80 ton 'Mech to collapse face first into the ground crushing Number Seven's cockpit, and Ford with it.

B89709C647321C91F466BAB62B327D74=Mary Tallman grew up around 'Mechs. Her father was a house Tech with the 22nd Avalon Hussars, and in her late teens, she built her own locust from spare parts. Being comfortable inside a 'Mech had its downside, and she chaffed under the classwork at NAIS, instead leaving and enlisting with the 22nd Avalon Hussars. With time two things became apparent, Mary was a competent officer and unlikely to see promotion past Company Commander. After 3 years with the Robinson DMM, she was offered her own command of the Bremmon Draconis March Militia, and quickly turned that troublesome unit around. An expert at atmospheric drops, it's no surprise Mary's 'Mech is one designed for planetary assault and her constant tinkering means that her Thunderbolt is anything but standard.

E204E72449C68D2F84ED94AABDE2AB4B=No sights on our Union yet, Garnet. But this place is crawling with our mystery raiders from the Jardin Spaceport.
4D7668DA45979C320A7EB99245CCC0A2=No sign of Mia.
844A74D14F9CE852A67A2D9DF9F1576A=No sign of activity, Jaguar Base.
FB71596A490A8069D718919FC3B4D8D7=No sign of reinforcements showing up. Guess they’re not here either.
7BCA5B6747F1BAB400C8F7AC2729B1F6=No sign of those missing ‘Mechs.
0D7580CC4144B809C5F4C483F7CA78DC=No sweat. One of our Omnimechs is worth five of theirs.
0E8C45D647E55EF460DFE698D21706BF=No target info!
A2DBF93240BBBC0B424F81BBE1AB883C=No target info!

2F25907648F94B4E7323A3BB00B78A31=No telling how many he has back there.
AFE647824AA1C439C4688483A9C4F30D=No time to rest. Move to the final active stronghold.
54AF85B044A415F2F8251595E23F1FC2=No true Smoke Jaguar does.

FFD4AFA042AE6BFADB372EB2F364E65C=No way to know. Not unless we find their ‘Mechs.
2A41384D4321D61631741AB626756B83=No way to target them!

8E7D6C0B4924F65B7947D19D432860DC=No wonder Ghost Bears were trying to outbid us here.
89A048C24148A28DB7D37981579C7AA8=No “smoke” without fire, ‘ei, Jaguars?
0B05DF38458A5D96E3D31194781AF60A=No! Cassidy, get the hell out of here! Don’t wait for me! GO!

63E047D9473DE9A36CDB1AB01FC9E928=No! How can you…
6038312C47F1AB66640050A96AADE2A4=No! I will not allow this!
9C03F81842D07AD8ED166DBE39009270=No! Just you, butcher!
68C089804C632B2BB35FC892E1E4E618=No! NO! Kerensky, NO!
123296164D72200CAF1426AEA5A349AD=No! Not yet. Clear the field first! He is not going anywhere.
487406994E169FDAEAFDF09E5AE1A483=No! Well... Not solely.
1518589D403105CB4E7CBCBAE07E85C8=No, Ez, he will go down as the one man that brought ruin to all of Smoke Jaguar!
DFE6198A419FCD0F1E176DAA2C61625F=No, I insist. Allow us to drag this across the finish line and make you look good.
F45EF6394D764C532B8CC389B0F19F90=No, I know I can do it.
49A90E7246C909534102098124E491D6=No, I'm with Mia. I'd rather get torn apart by large cats, than have to climb those damn Grey Mountain cliffs again.
3FC30A22400F18D83F38E193AEC7EF03=No, Liam has always been this way.
3E0FBC8A4139DA007F112C89ABF07C84=No, Star Colonel.

AD884F4E41B7AD5791AD78B7F0A00A17=No, but I plan to take her as bondsman for the Dragoons. She is not to be killed! She is family. We are not going to give up on her. We just need to give her an honorable way out of the hole she is in.
FB2254A24CEE13C3B84BEFB928968D87=No, not to us.
A9B07256455A49DE75DEBCAF88680180=No, not when they are the ones who stand to win glory conquering new worlds.
10A318BA4710455217D9E5B95E5CEA72=No, this is Smoke Jaguar’s dominion now, and we will rule better than your traitorous House Kurita ever could.
DCB5EE9A43395AE114842F8B671AE8DA=No, we cannot. Our assets have gone silent since their last report. They are currently unresponsive.
3D94B2F641484EECDEBEFDAE5C12A9B5=No, we cannot. Our assets have gone silent since their last report. They are currently unresponsive. 
6777EF1C4A4909539611FABC69452BC4=No, you did not.
2783A86C4165AF1E5BC75482CF60118F=No, you misunderstand. The Ryugawa claim that he has already jumped out of the system!
6BBF69854DC1C19B9021C88984A197AC=No, your logic is sound. This LAW facility alone will be a devastating blow to them. But I would not count them out yet. The closer we march on the Imperial Palace, the more fanatic the resistance will be.
18B68C0E4EB94F492B9CC0B98C8DD9AD=No.
27251B29494FA0E712AA9595DB12EE71=No.
4A634E0941465EAF780064AADD569017=No.
82452BCD45E38DBDCBE825810A840DFE=No.
BAB62D5E4D86ADED1479498D7BC1D1B1=No. Even against freeborns, he could not have been that stupid.
35E22CF24F4CFD767EF5FAAD7DE8377A=No. He thinks the hope of resistance the ALAG brings is a cancer. Perez is trying to burn it out before it can spread.
4777462D49B68C4435DA07BF88202FF4=No. I already lost my home to Rasalhaguian filth once. I will not lose this one! 
DC5C345D483E8A6E16DFCDAB798A7010=No. Not all of us.
60C4572B4D0A002479FBD5984C3AD3D6=No. The Clans revere honorable combat. To take advantage of the rules of engagement for personal gain is frowned upon.
C0794D4848669E6484DFB6AAA50801A9=No. They die.
7EBE5B504BDB5F152BA7698457FC7119=No. We are here for you! To show you how short sighted the Jaguar has become... how far it has strayed from its purpose.
8943874945942B197EFD1AA935449054=No. Which Clan works as hard as ours? The Nova Cats are too busy looking for visions, Clan Wolf are getting far too friendly with the enemy, and I do not fancy Ghost Bear’s chances against our speed.
53F58953417BDAC2EB32A286F4FE5F0A=No... He was as good as any of us…
294C510644A2BA5DFA817E9206E0FBFE=Non Objective

73EA07B34971866F4617CBB8FAA2FA2E=None that we can see. Best to pick up the pace before they can entrench themselves.
141E346D42F402C3282437A9BA0B0DF1=None, Galaxy Commander.
5A37AD0C42BA484D9B2C7082478B2D89=Nonoperational left leg!
A91A7CAF4301DC8A2CFE05825CEF7113=Nor can our will to break you.
D256570645161569BAFDC7B12AEC6C9D=Norseman is clear!
38AC67D2492E0F7F6A88EFA36EA0ED5B=Northeastern flank. Already engaged!
3F1F5CCA4C812544D353EDBB8E113971=Northern Plains, Edo

C8465C0D4D1C7764185BC69850E4F534=Not Complete
CCD990B246E104C169A4F4ABC1D48FD6=Not a bad call. The armada can wait till later.
C68BE57C4B4AF96E6B881983633BB627=Not a desirable outcome. But at least a measly bomber will not be carrying anything. I will send fighters in pursuit. Cobalt, concentrate on stamping this operation out.
9F201056402C875592B4638B940675FF=Not a problem. These Spheroids are outclassed, at least against us.
336C6AAA41B97D5BEFE0EEA22854B2AE=Not a trace. Nothing.
F8EC76FD420F7822DF5DF984898DAF92=Not all my men have access to advanced Clan tech. You need to work as a team and support one another to make up the difference. Also, with that killzone pre-spotted for both artillery and airstrikes, you do not want to venture into it. We will not halt fire if you do. Stick to the plan until ordered to do otherwise. Got it?
E1B670124C238119D3B7DC81855D830F=Not bad, but we are better!
B0E3B1834C162702D99E81B1C539E541=Not by choice. The ALAG are mercenaries indentured to the Combine state. To them, it is a choice of facing us or the executioner’s blade for disobeying their masters. 
3952AD3D4BFA3BCAE0969899E9E572AA=Not enough funds to purchase the required items
AE8EDFBC4E68A666A55242A54540FEA4=Not even lives. 
1937B93142C92F0AD40439ACCAB96D58=Not everyone has our mentality of charging into battle.

BB279F134D9653245B0A3EA25CC3944F=Not for long.
C89CCD434FDD70AD09676298F4EA17EB=Not funny! You know I hate that.
53656DF640E42B31946C64AA8DE70152=Not going to last out here! Punching out!
94E10F114D0903C0749A43888D34B653=Not good.  If that is true, we need to hunt them down before they can escape.
519ED58B4691393CAA6E3291B2C054BD=Not helpful Liam.
CAF11F7549D677A4534C459003B4C3C3=Not if we can help it! Their DropShip has not left yet!
4F962D4C495F6551815B188FE3CD76E9=Not if we get to it first!
80327C194D351C7C406E50982091BBBB=Not join their ranks!
23C3C3A2423A5A396570E89E3B592767=Not me? 
5818C7274BAF3A188D4950BC19ED7F8D=Not militia. They seem better coordinated and more confident than the militia ever was.
ED21666F4E12E16C2191EAB452F38B93=Not much fight left in them.
588F4D494FCAEC28E690F9AE63DB762F=Not much, I’m afraid.
D29C43B9408B243E8B0858A3B5B3F722=Not much, I’m afraid.
6290EDB34E040C0123E23F8DA8C644DA=Not my idea of a day at the beach.
7B813E584ADD17917DC0B29896601967=Not my idea of a day at the beach.
0CCD62C64C18ABAD24A49E8DF18E41F9=Not once they realize how superior our forces are.
540134634F72ECBA14DAB1A18FDBE1A4=Not only has it taken its toll on our force, but on my patience too. I will not allow us to be beaten by criminals!
78E3BA9B4FEC090ECE51E287B2BD3CEB=Not only has it taken its toll on our force, but on my patience too. I will not allow us to be beaten by criminals!
8B00AA4D4819D7CF3B4C04883C4B3775=Not possible, Star Commander.
9A58955B4D589337FD886D9D48718300=Not possible, Star Commander.

C5E9D11345CFE703D7F75DB81343C049=Not possible.
D42DDBFD4190F240B4D7A5B0CDF7261E=Not quite, Star Commander. During the fighting, we tracked multiple ‘Mechs fleeing the scene. Those who fought here were likely the ones injured or willing to hold us back while the rest fled. This is not over yet. Prepare to go on the hunt.
452DE7A14823EB9B5EAA33840EA3215C=Not since the planetary militia fell.
69FA7FFE46BB440EE44BA5B1B2812E4A=Not snipers… LRM carriers! Quick! Get to cover!
C05ECAB743F40D1D747CE69EE118E969=Not so fast, Cobalt One.  My Star is picking up movement. We have hostiles closing in. 
1C5CD5CF44606515E9789AB7835D3353=Not so fast, Cobalt One. I am tracking a Kuritan DropShip inbound on your position. Seconds out. Brace for more contact.
6FBF924B4933EA4F7E8281967655B54F=Not so tough without their cheap tricks.
C7E271D04498B716342881BDEF053742=Not so, Cobalt One. We have just sighted a DropShip landing at your position, carrying heavy reinforcements. They are sparing no assets to try and pick you apart. Do not engage, Cobalt. This is the time for a tactical withdrawal.
E71327F3445D42D8ED8F228138CD0BE0=Not sure, but they are eager to protect something.
99608A8B4436A20EE7EADE9C86CC79CD=Not sure. Get to the window.
2F9396654DA647FA776A468AB2329073=Not sure. I wonder…
2A2975754CF964D0E43F10B9CCFBEB7F=Not sure. Silver One, what is the status on our support?
CD4FB7B344312EE2D6D4BFBF7B3FB4A7=Not sure. The briefing never said what Jaguar Cluster managed to break through.
5CEAF7BE421DB0798730C69B1C65A777=Not very Clan-like of you to torment the elderly.
95AA091C49706BFE181773AC39C536FE=Not while I still stand! I might not be able to stop all of Smoke Jaguar, but I sure as hell can stop YOU!  I issue you a call to trial, if you have any honor left in you.
BFACD321468817D80DFE1F842E41979A=Not without becoming the very monsters they claim to be fighting.
7DC30A1845B698837B6C9C8D42CE346A=Not worth considering. There is no room for half measures.
36496DD94634EDF4A528B89451C7A7A3=Not yet encountered
E6047E7E4F402EE06E39C89282C47A30=Not yet. What do you think?

E86FE3324521F978EFC8D5B66D908B2B=Nothing else here for us. Move out.
C39A9E8346BEC5D78705218A722FFF62=Nothing good, I’m afraid, Morgan. We took the brunt of the last Nova Cat push, but a bombing run made them think twice on pushing our position. They fell back to regroup, but I fear they will try to push through your line next.
753E854B44FB3338E9D3C1810EE72796=Nothing more we can do. Fall back!
502999C74CD0D98DE912D2900DBA5873=Nothing on scanners. Opening keel bay doors. Prepare for drop.
FF35F31F42EA07FE83C42389A7805172=Nothing on scopes. I think we are in the clear.
60A9B3EF43D4E9AF87DFC6A702E06068=Nothing on sensors, Jaguar One. All militia forces are dead or knocked offline. 
57DFA0A7450F996D254010821239ABDD=Nothing out of the ordinary. Union 717, you are free to launch when you are ready.
B6132A5C4E1C48F7D2AD8C84FB3FF477=Nothing we have not seen before!
13F04D9946ACF4803C708A9FAADB7366=Nothing you could do, Jayden.
534EC88C4F02F906E81E998F45835890=Nothing. He is going to have to step up on his own. Luckily, these raiders may allow him to do just that. It might be his only chance.
41D2C09B4119147414CFE3BB63562BE0=Nothing. Moving on.

AD1981594CDE3956CE43ECAEC3874CC1=Nova Cat assault forces broke off from The Jaguars. I guess each Clan is out for themselves.

C7EC05FA4BD9C83A05A78CB3815B5CFB=Oh please… GROW UP, EZRA! Perez’s actions made him a PARIAH! That is NOT who we are!
FC1908434F9B0593E479B19AE007ABA4=Oh please… You are loving this.  
034861144C44853DE8956ABE4E54E9FD=Oh yeah? Try and keep up with me.
54EA1F234E04654B5E90C5B4121CBA06=Oh, I never stopped. You would not believe some of the stuff I’ve been able to get my hands on. Even got a few communiqués out there waiting for responses.
756149C94CD5DBDCB3FC8091B778F2C8=Oh, and guys, try not to kill any of them. No telling how the Kit Masters will react if we break their star pupils.
062041084E3A11FB130933A16C503107=Oh, but you have fought nothing but freebirths and lowly MechWarriors so far. You have never seen the likes of me!
0081DDF74FF563AA62EC7B82DA095C0E=Oh, do not worry. I plan on killing each and every one of you myself. I will etch your deaths into my codex and smile on it fondly. This is the day I excise the traitors who SPAT in the face of Kerensky.
C0A46F4940C9A4D4A653DFBACDDF6CAD=Oh, that sounds like fun. Come on Jayden!
FBF791DB46E368DDCD1A6AAAF4B5BB02=Oh, that’s a big boy.
461CF6C4490AD856DC0B6A914B39CD75=Oh, they do, but only for themselves. The Jaguar Regulars are a second-line cluster staffed with old and second-rate warriors on the verge of a solahma assignment. Many likely see this fight as their last chance to die honorably against a worthy opponent.
318449044B996D219CBB7B8E85E4FCF6=Ok you two, that is enough. Try to minimize chatter.
96A8252F47074CCF9A76CEBDEE05EC15=Ok, I should be clear.
D789C1C24FF179928E45DF9616B89410=Ok, I think we found the gate tower. Inputting codes now.
CC4FE3A4444145DDCBB695AABC6C4B6F=Ok, another one down. Setting waypoint to the next one. Move out.
C2E5642B4FC478FAADFFD3B8D1AE95CD=Ok, eyes up team. They might have gotten the regulars but they will not get us.
671FEE23441BB464AB6DBA8D639B25C0=Ok, gone private. What is on your mind?
E23F35AE48A309F479C62A90637C6DD4=Ok, sensors are saying the data pack download is complete.
FDAA8F2C4893B49E414709A0AA0B2CA1=Ok, that’s the last one. Ezra?
A211AD1A4666DD6357EF2F8C8F2ECEC0=Ok, they were a bit more difficult to defeat, but nothing we can’t handle.
4F98A0074B1FF394E1589E990BF6A14F=Ok, we are at the gate.
229885374721E4E7DD7A5BBF47A9A1DF=Ok. According to this, the Jaguar Guards were ambushed here. The Binary was able to fight them off but took three losses.
34B7649C43113E13BCF4558713AEDB70=Ok. This should be good.
D56260C24DB0FD1DB459DEACE0E15C92=Okay! I think…
46ADA5A344BFA002046176A86C0AA06B=Okay, Cobalt, get ready. I see the way out. We have DCMS lined up to greet us! We need to punch through them!
386544BE441EE59B1A35A4838AA4BD1D=Okay, we have a straight shot to the gate. Radar has more Jag resistance guarding it.
3EF1FB58440F9563A83C819BB063F26B=Okay, we take care of these clanners and we have a straight shot to the DropShip!
13721F7F4427EE0A22771D9BF4F93330=Okay.
E652FBF846E47A9128AEECA37CE72338=Okay. But we will not slow down to scoop you up if they prove too strong for you.
D1C943EB4D00E649118B7D8539724F85=Okay. Not too bad so far…
8F8EDC0645E47815036CDBA73189C17E=Okay…

Her timely interruption of an assassination attempt on Paula 'Lady Death' Trevaline quickly earned her the famed pirate's favor, as well as the command of Scourge Company. Obsessed with detail, Portia has served with distinction on several scouting missions along the Concordat border. Perhaps more distinctive however is her penchant for using her Firestarter to set off incredible conflagrations. Her obsessive nature is at work here too, as when these raging fires are viewed from above they bear a remarkable symmetry that some liken to works of art. Perhaps it's this artistic mayhem that caused her to modify her 'Mech, moving all the flamers into the arms for extra precision.

59BE115743A79E498454C38B84F1374F=Raised among mercenaries her entire life, Rhonda Snord was born to be a MechWarrior. When she was a child, her father, Cranston Snord, was discharged from the Wolf's Dragoons accused of abandoning his post to hunt for ancient artwork. He would go on to form his own mercenary unit 'Snords Irregulars' and built up a reputation as a treasure hunter and historian of the ancient Star League, building a collections of preserved artwork and texts from humanity's lost golden age. Although itself a relic of the Star League, Rhonda's 'Heavy Metal' was a beast of her own creation. Sporting a distinct Pink camo scheme and mounting external stadium speakers, Rhonda used Heavy Metal to flood the battlefield with late 20th century rock and heavy metal music as she took to the field.

Both of these traits were most likely amplified by her admiration of her equally rebellious CO Greg Oliphant. Oliphant himself was well known for sharing a flair for the dramatic with his own Banshee 'The Court Jester' which has been decorated with a giant fool's cap with bells and an elongated grin seemed to be the inspiration for Voss' Chesire Cat grin on her own Jester.

An pilot known for his remarkable agility in a 'Mech, using it to distract and dodge enemy fire while his lance-mates moved in for the kill. Whether this Zeus really was his isn't clear. It isn't forest green, and the battle computer got wiped during the extensive upgrades. It's not known whether the MASC system is among the recent additions though, leading to speculation whether Sealth really was so talented, or whether someone with more money than skills wanted to copy his tactics.

Commissioned by the Terran Hegemony 2456 as a response to the increasing improvements to ’Mech designs used by other Houses, the Orion is nearly half a millennium old. Mounting over fourteen tons of armor and a weapons load leaning toward ballistic options, the Orion is a hardy ’Mech capable of dealing and sustaining a great deal of punishment.

EB31E509414A4427C34D55BD331387DE=Thank Kerensky for that. I can only do so many months of endless drills and maintenance checks. Some action will help hone our senses before the fresh meat returns from the homeworlds.
F717B5C944102DC38AB844A85608D27B=Thank you for coming.
7D4ECBBA4BDBDF48A782F3A7C05E48C4=Thank you saKhan for the update. Moving over to the task at hand, with our foothold in the Waseda hills taken, we can now move into the Imperial City, where each cluster has been assigned high priority targets to take.
A38304324E832AFB8E6ECDBFE352B1A2=Thank you saKhan for the update. Moving over to the task at hand. With our foothold in the Waseda hills taken, we can now move into the Imperial City, where each cluster has been assigned high-priority targets to take.
6B47D796425A275F3D2B31BEE4452A27=Thank you saKhan, for everything. One way or another, Terra will soon feel our wrath!
16C9C77F469792435DA05C86C5F09771=Thank you, Colonel!
3D39A6E842A8551983BDEFB95788FB41=Thank you, Colonel. That is all we ask.
7D66A0C8475A9666804D788D83080C78=Thank you, Colonel. That is all we ask.
562D6A5049CE0B200B0AAC9C038C93E7=Thank you, Star Captain. Good hunting.
0917AFA7484976FD30CF8B9792B53E51=Thank you, Star Colonel.

0A6A8C55439279F0FE00DAB76A40F583=Thank you, Star Colonel. I look forward to working with you and Galaxy Commander Perez for many years to come.
8FA9CE444889A485F14C4CBD08C3F31D=Thank you, Star Colonel. Leave it to us to break through. Your MechWarriors can bring up the rear.
3665F9BC4945A41D14A5EE9F37D3DDC6=Thank you, Star Commander. Taking off.
1742434C44AE3177430F708B453E1C14=Thank you, warrior. You fought honorably. I wish I had more like you under my command.
EAB5CFC84631719E813259813B59458D=Thanks Cobalt. Opening the gates now.
D8FFD5564A96602DFAF0C583EE4435C8=Thanks for having my back.
9CBAC4524FBE933B5359B8B286B3C218=Thanks for verifying Ez. Hadn’t noticed between all the bombs and gunfire.
52CB0DC5487E9682956CA7913017925B=Thanks to the First Sword, we were able to fend off the Nova Cats and retrieve some of the Kell Hounds, so we want to return the favor and prevent the Clanners from taking possession of their facility.
E47423EE4BFEE78232E75BB4632F4C2F=Thanks to the First Sword, we were able to fend off the Nova Cats and retrieve some of the Kell Hounds, so we want to return the favor and prevent the Clanners from taking possession of their facility.
1CF356774EEA2AE6D4ECE2A3225BCF56=Thanks to us, Luthien and the Draconis Combine have emerged victorious.
208CAD7147EEC0C5F1B85C85FA448FBF=Thanks, Alex. Everyone, patch up!
90E784BF40E7F58FDE170496C2533133=Thanks, Star Commander.

0AEB255749A9F34AB05687B82B696919=Thanks. Star Colonel, Cobalt Star is on-site! East side of the spaceport.
A5FB6B574A83590A5F279285C35E8BFF=That 'Mech never stood a chance!
CEEC51A14F0867B7F571DFADC1632AE1=That 'Mech's going down!
109B95F946FF9BC1DE8838A924F73877=That DropShip is carrying Clan military equipment! How did they get that?
15DA9C65406A0AD5602C6F854600021B=That Kit Commander’s punch hit like a ton of bricks. I think he broke some ribs.
72EA2D5F4B3DCA8D7EEE9F8DB4563FFF=That Union’s about to go critical! Clear the area!
E2DC32084DC6016ADB50788F73972D04=That console contained gate codes. We will be able to pass through there now.
F938F2E7400592BA86A62383E587C8CF=That did it. Door is opening up!
2322C1CD485F13F35690E9B6E08A4F5F=That did it. Gates are opening.
4B242E754DD2319E10D238AB255180C1=That did not take long.
F34A5E084C74CBF1D91F0CA9351D5451=That did not take long. Our might has dusted the courage off these cowards.
379C33E14E25F710A427B9B754D67B8D=That did the trick. The door is opening.
EC490DBE44035CF2CF99DBA46262CCEA=That does not inspire confidence.
BCCF9DB74511A69DC3EDEBA9550AB8BE=That does not seem to be a lot to go on.
C8D29B444E2EC4836EA94D84F3E62A44=That does not seem to be a lot to go on.
FD9A8CBE4A12F85AB73065A5E1135072=That escalated quickly.
6B1510FD4823B20ECA2C8E9436775F61=That freebirth called you out! Are you seriously going to let that go unanswered?
4229C4464D6116D01D08E0BA83D27381=That gate just swung open.
8426D27940A9FA6019AE8FA1152B3CC8=That gives me hope that it is still intact and we can retrieve it.
6C25F2904DCD9521A4981989EEE189AD=That his life is more important than anyone else?!
1D3436C8466A3D8779F0F79773D0327D=That hull armor is thick. Cobalt, best to scan that thing for weaknesses!
203E6A3C47EAAAE8F443A7AA56B3878F=That is a bullseye! We got the key to crack this place wide open. But…
20E12F464424E55FBBA8E8AFEA4430C6=That is a no-go, Star Commander.
65762AE44933A4D34A7FA3BAFE8E798D=That is an Orion. Aleksandr Kerensky used it to kick in the palace doors of the usurper.
679E1E8046F2DF5AE6FD7BA5FDA71936=That is an affirmative, Star Commander.
8F77F9194835481226CE6594C3F84916=That is every last building. But I do not feel good about it.
8CCB50404E4BFBE2BBB42396232DB49C=That is exactly what I want you to find out. Demi-Precentor...
91EAA5B44FBE65F4D651868918CFB153=That is exactly what I want you to find out... Demi-Precentor.
2103A4A2425F183BD72FDCB7B0EED6ED=That is excellent work, Cobalt. We will question the prisoners to see if they possess vital information about Valasek’s whereabouts. We will root this coward out one way or another.
501C58B74DE8B5D226C4EB9682F6A0C5=That is funny coming from someone who was still gestating in an iron womb when most of the Clan Touman was being blooded in battle.
84E5D8D542F98EFEE4F7488682997C03=That is good news.
C4AF1FB247AD73DCC8C2D29F27ECD534=That is good news.
4F81896F4EA70812C73C87A140D653EB=That is not ideal.
336A078A45852F134E443DBA04230027=That is not saying much.
0AD1102E48C9217DAA455E89747741E1=That is not the way of the Clans.
54B64F2F4B9DD36264829F88EFAA2F95=That is now two confirmed kills for Kit Jayden!
D611196647EE5D60DA402682DBFEDAB3=That is one confirmed kill. Enough to earn the rank of MechWarrior.
27EB399A4317DBA079236D8646628D6A=That is still more than these spheroids hav, even with their machines.
8DC1378B43807D12E688A49D763EBE5C=That is the DCMS. This… This is the work of the ISF. House Kurita’s security bureau. I do not believe they hold themselves to the same sense of honor.
E05F5C7C465FEA43E97468A9F8D669B2=That is the code! Grab it and go!
50D3E04D47362F4F878E5D8A40EF4FA8=That is the last of them! Now get up into that ship!
CD921ED340E3C944B38E71BA0F897ED1=That is the last of them, I think.
16553714416B1D6C366CB986BB7AFA7C=That is the point. The Combine has a long history of throwing willing bodies at any problem. In the Succession Wars, they would empty the prisons to do it. As they would say… “They can choke on our dead.”
A91C09E34BE912B4F718D59E927AFB37=That is what Shadow One said. Do not let your ambitions get the better of you. Or you will find yourself overseeing salvage cleanup for more competent warriors.
C6A7129E4A14F3B0F7247BA535F69C08=That is what Shadow One said. Do not let your ambitions get the better of you. Or you will find yourself overseeing salvage cleanup for more competent warriors.
BE50CD374F58A09F0F0624B6433E5B94=That is what makes this place different and beautiful. Turtle Bay’s heavy industry is mining asteroids in the rings. No ugly factories plaguing the planet itself.
C24CA958432FC0469F3031AA74C3680C=That is what they are built for... what she is built for.
784F359341104400FAD459916D96591E=That is where you come in, Star Commander.
898BC8C746299946154CCB95838D04D7=That is where you come in, Star Commander.
94AFAB7F46189A524438A29AC6B19CEB=That is why the Tenth’s nickname is “Death Before Retreat.”
F34CE1844C28232DB73151A5B5676324=That is why the Tenth’s nickname is “Death Before Retreat.”
8CC56FED4098D12E91C39E81E8122741=That is why they need the bombers. Make up for their shitty ‘Mechs.
B95C57BC4F07DEBF37C1F1AA3922459D=That is why we are here. Cobalt will take the van, but we appreciate any help we can get.
75776CB44049CF29DD85C2A1104AFB88=That is your problem, Ezra. Unwilling to go that extra inch to carry out your duty.
A1C9AD73487434CFF7C318A4297A88D9=That isn't possible!
EB742D4D4210DECFDC3426B56E82CCF2=That kill is mine!
635F3336454972F54C1980B8255295CC=That looked like the last of them.
480717E848DE0B45B08DB9BE817BB8EE=That makes things easier.
F1FA9F5D46183B9111544282A2FDE99C=That makes things easier.
D766DF79494C86C190ECE1BB80F067E2=That means nothing coming from your mouth, not after what you did to Edo! We may fall but if it gives the Combine what it needs to END each and every one of you bastards, it’s a sacrifice everyone here is willing to pay!
0162A79B415978B233F4EF91B1BDFF04=That means they're fighting blind and are currently unaware of our presence.
9D5F5F5A471219F0ABC291A0073870D9=That mission was a mess. Explain yourself.
2BCF1984425CD646C8F4F28760F73760=That must have been a long time ago.
6AAE4E244BB18E380C81FD990989655F=That payload, that’s not a standard payload. Stravag! They’ve converted it into a giant Gunship!
420420354FD7F9FE998EF09DEA660AB4=That reactor is going to blow!
84F0A50845E7C2C34BD6A9B60EBC84E7=That reactor's gonna blow!
AACD05E84C002421D13BC29118641F51=That scout won’t be delivering any status updates now.
EBC264F741D67B7B6629E1A9060801EF=That seems to be the last of them for now.
2565187B4F7EEFF492E1168C35F4A67C=That seems to be the last of them.
E51C4EF1461C7A35619AB791D5329F75=That ship's turret guns are live!
F037DBA94152B116E83DAEA5D3C8ED81=That should be all of them.
33EFD3B84060C94BDE95A9A8D343AC49=That should do it out here.
B0CB3798434E403FBB6E8FAB091E3217=That should keep us operational until the job is done. 
E6ABBA0E43EB27183F83D284B77A2F69=That skirmish slowed you down. Keep moving. Time is not your ally here.
80F4B0BC455F7F4C83EA3A8E7A9B1109=That still leaves us with the issue of the planetary militia.
6704D04844AE4E65FE9952B1BE85413A=That took my Right Arm!
76B996EB4E77EC8F3ED2C3B046CE8F31=That was a good precision shot!
616234A44AE41B65ACD1C5AA463AEB04=That was a hard blow!
0178F6264CE16558BEE6E29475B25EE9=That was a heavy hitter!
177858184FB9C4C7ADAB909583A7FD7F=That was a real clean, well executed job. You did what was required, and that'll keep you alive out here.
9412F8394E2B9EE425EA7AB15A462348=That was all of them.
7F12F7C84EFD8E713604D396D363A041=That was an order, not a suggestion. Move out!
8051A54D40D4AD25C2502A8DF7777C91=That was close…
396C3AA54A2709BECD0090AAB9366736=That was different and you know it.
EB81182947682ADB319E868E6F754032=That was embarassing out there. You best hope that the galaxy is quick to forget your actions.
3B9ACCA24123154644FE7E8F9BF57E33=That was excellent, this mission was an unmitigated success. Your mother would be proud.
48A982624B6300E9B9AEF785A69F3084=That was in the time of the Star League. During the Succession Wars, those towers were destroyed in raids by House Steiner.
9109EBCF45E6F1212F0F6D82D64FE938=That was in the time of the Star League. During the Succession Wars, those towers were destroyed in raids by House Steiner.
83279793400A2F12968442AA84772BBD=That was it? What did they think would happen?
606DC65447C03E3BC240B2BA48DD23A0=That was just the beginning. Additional contacts are approaching The Eastern Gate.
C6DBD9F2477D1C4F89CE2CB5E851FEA7=That was no small gesture. She sacrificed her own honor to minimize the fallout on us.
4C58C5F6448A2BAF3ECF959CED0BFDEA=That was our experience. They have both armor and BattleMech assets at their disposal.
0A1DF78A4E2788D45876999B11E227F3=That was pathetic. It looks like your parents haven't taught you much, have they?
1A9441274430C3860F71A680E316C661=That was pathetic. It looks like your parents haven't taught you much, have they?
3FED373C4A5BAD59EE2938B6F386A701=That was pathetic. It looks like your parents haven't taught you much, have they?
7FF6A1F8464D36FF4247CD80A56EA8F1=That was pathetic. It looks like your parents haven't taught you much, have they?
D07DE8AB4F3BC1318060ECB95DBEDA4B=That was pathetic. It looks like your parents haven't taught you much, have they?
D5B1F1F04E447020C7CD2E946E751787=That was pathetic. It looks like your parents haven't taught you much, have they?
B806FC87401817C4B958A2A01252B699=That way a part of you will be right there with me for my trial.
DC53FFBB41FBD3193CAC238109F73985=That will be impossible to forget once they start shooting at us.
81B3F5E54AFFF65B4B8F07AEBB534250=That will grant us a great tactical advantage.
8CF215DF48F61CAB8621A5B08F2710CF=That will grant us a great tactical advantage.
DEB5CFAA414DCFDB797D6594EC10C656=That will not help anyone.
7D2AEE724F5812AE0EED3C8DA0178AFB=That won’t right itself until we get out of this dead zone.
58C24C4F496C7F69E7BF6F9AE2D0CF31=That's a neg!

F5A3A8E44C8B0650CCF77A9A5269AE2D=That, or we can clip their wings from here. Those launcher arms are big targets.

A6369E0E4006506E4F9E0F9359E6E365=That’s all of them. Nothing notable yet. Let’s head to the next target.
E9C3FF6E49887B54C20825B5AAA37F6A=That’s all of them. We should investigate where they came from and get out of here.
C3BCC1434FF49E8572764F9685E19AF1=That’s for the Clan Watch to worry about.

5EA847A747BA70E3BCD7C48EC1877956=The 'Mech Bay is where you can assign, modify, and repair all the 'Mechs under your command. From here, you can enter the 'Mech Lab to change each 'Mech's OmniPods, weapon and equipment loadouts, weapon groups, and camo patterns.<cf><cf>When a 'Mech is damaged, you can assign members of the technician caste to repair it. Each technician assigned to a 'Mech will be able to fix an amount of damage for each cycle before the next mission. Through spending Merits, you can requisition more technicians and improve the amount they can repair each cycle.

DECB08934BD91EFF55E083BA63F5812F=The 362nd now has two major objectives:
3815F4BE48DAFA330C28D8BB4E906E87=The 362nd took heavy losses clearing out the Luthien Armor Works campus. If you go through with this, I do not have the manpower to help you.

114E0D4945CE05A7B57E5696C831D49C=The 362nd took heavy losses taking that factory. I think many other clusters are suffering a similar fate. With the Nova Cats withdrawing, all those Combine forces tied up with them will turn their attention to us. We need to get out of here before that happens. Sure we could fight these freebirths to a standstill and possibly win but it would cripple our ability to take our true prize.
0A06EDBE460AE0D3FA7C8AAD4323E28C=The 362nd will be assaulting the primary ‘Mech factory campus for Luthien Armor Works.

4D4AF43E4971ABE8560D79956BF70D37=The Alshain Regulars were formed from the pardoned Rasalhague Regulars after the Ronin War. Since many lost their homes when Rasalhague declared independence, there is a strong culture of tenacity and resilience.

92A9B3494CB36DE06D28F3943DEAA095=The Archer piloted by Morgan Kell on that day in early 3016 has moved into the world of myth and legend. Determined to protect the lives and honor of the surrounded Kell Hounds mercenary regiment, Morgan Kell stepped forward in Tempest to sacrifice himself in single combat with enemy commander, Yorinaga Kurita, despite his Archer's obvious lack of close combat weaponry. But as the killing blow fell at near point blank range, Kell's 70 ton war machine emerged completely unscathed. Eyewitness accounts claimed that despite seeing the 'Mech with their own eyes, no computerized sensor detected the Archer's presence. As if the 'Mech was nothing more than a phantom. No credible explanation of the phenomenon has been put forward to this day.
FE18F2794CEC16D36CE76B9F36F2904E=The Armada is still months away from returning and Perez holds a lot of sway with the commanders left in charge. Not much we can do until saKhan Weaver returns.

6A2C9235432F3986ED65488CBF7632D8=The Blackjack was born from a Star League mandate in 2757 for the creation of a new BattleMech "with insurgency suppression and fire-support capabilities." Despite fulfilling its production requirements and performing well in initial tests, the Blackjack unfairly developed a bad reputation and was all but rejected by the Star League. While its original design suits the Blackjack for engagement against lighter opponents, its range and sustained fire capability can make it a highly effective threat in the right hands.

042B06AA4B9F03BC804583864A39A295=The Capellan Confederation found itself desperately short of heavy and assault BattleMechs during the final years of the Third Succession War. The Cataphract was born directly from that need. Pride quickly turned to embarrassment as the sole Cataphract production facility was lost to Davion forces only a few years after it became operational in 3025, and shortly thereafter the Cataphract could be found among the ranks of enemy garrison units. At first glance the Cataphract seems to be an attempt to make a heavy BattleMech as versatile as possible, given its mix of weaponry and an abundance of armor.

693DE10643AEB3C6E8046FA30C5E04AF=The Federated Suns units that encountered this new 'Mech were confused, mistaking it for a Charger. As the war of 3039 progressed, it became clear that the Hatamoto-Chi, the first 'Mech in the Hatamoto chassis line, was something entirely different. Clearly matching the capabilities of the old Star League era Thug Battlemech, it appears that the Hatamoto-Chi still came from the Charger mold, likely because it was just easier and faster to use the already running Charger assembly line. It does so to its benefit too, retaining the ease to repair that's one of the Chargers few praise points, as well as removing at least some of the stigma surrounding that old maligned design.

Jayden, you will be on standby as a reserve force while the rest of the Second Jaguar Regulars participate in the trial. You will not engage unless activated.
AFC4BB1545F90A96E87BB8A99D62AFA8=The Gargoyle, also known as the Man O' War to the Inner Sphere, is still a commonly used 'Mech throughout the invasion. As an inverse to the role you would normally see in an assault 'Mech, the Gargoyle charges into battle with extreme speed and lacks firepower for a 'Mech of its size. Able to take the brunt of enemy attacks and yet carry the speed of a medium or heavy 'Mech to lead the charge, the Gargoyle sits in a strange place on the invasion roster. Its weaponry is akin to a medium 'Mech, and it carries almost all of its weapons in its arms, making it a liability in extended fights due to the ease of stripping off its weapons. Due to these drawbacks and smaller 'Mechs being able to achieve similar goals, there are speculations about whether the Gargoyle is worth the cost of such a large platform. Regardless of these reservations, the Gargoyle is a common sight during the invasion.

912BDECD4F2FF9408FF0929082BABF11=The Hatchetman that would be known as 'Man-at-Arms' began life as one of the models the Lyran Commonwealth sent to the Federated Sun prior to the Fourth Succession War. It initially served with the Second NAIS Cadet Cadre where it received a number of refits and experimental equipment, including the newly rediscovered LB 10-X Autocannon. In 3038 it was transferred to Federated Suns' unit McKinnon's Company, 'The Fox's Teeth', and was assigned to veteran MechWarrior Austin Vorster. This was a substantial upgrade to the old STG-3R Stinger he had inherited from his late father.
4F6FBDE14895B6EA52047DA00071E42F=The Highlander known as 'Redshank' belonged to Roz Sheridan, a senior member of the independent mercenary command Dragon's Breath. The group is known for carefully shifting and balancing the large outstanding debt that they owe to several Lyran banks. This has not only resulted in them having to constantly take mercenary contracts, but their MechWarriors have become skilled marksmen so as to maximize the value of any battlefield salvage. Unfortunately for Sheridan and Dragon's Breath, the loss of 'Redshank' will only increase their debt.

F712CAFA4897D2FF26F33F897345A4F6=The Inner Sphere never gave the Shadow Cat a code name. No pilot that encountered one survived, and no record escaped the planet it deployed on. ComStar later learned of the 'Mech and its actual clan name, which ended with both sides knowing it as the Shadow Cat. The Shadow Cat was mainly deployed in the later stages of the invasion despite being produced in 3003 by Clan Nova Cat. It continued to serve as a steadfast 'Mech choice long after the invasion despite numerous attempts to class it out and replace it. A unique feature of the Shadow Cat is the MASC equipped on this 'Mech, allowing short bursts of extreme speed to gain on enemies or flee from hostile areas.

5641956040F5B5A49695428ED0F4BF70=The Kintaro was originally designed in 2587 as a frontline unit designed to deliver Narc missile beacons for ally forces. With the loss of the last known Narc factory in 2792, the Kintaro became simply another missile platform, and lead eventually to the production of the downgraded KTO-18 by the Federated Suns. Whatever the variant, the Kintaro is still a tough frontline 'Mech capable of delivering an impressive salvo of missiles for a 'Mech of its size.

DAB14C134DC1B7E96421BDB32470CA12=The Kit Fox is a Clan Cloud Cobra design and no Smoke Jaguar plants produce it, making Kit Fox a rare sight in their roster. When first encountered by Inner Sphere forces, its effectiveness earned Kit Fox the codename Uller, after the Norse God of Archery. While most Clan light ‘Mechs prioritize speed and mobility for scouting, the Kit Fox is a rarer breed. Only moving at 97.2 KPH, the Kit Fox is a slow combat light that focuses on support with a dizzying array of long-range firepower. Each Kit Fox configuration prepares weapons for any engagement, from long-range fire to close-quarters combat against any target unlucky enough to close.

E4E1E3BB4138B0A24877008F1B1F073E=The Kuro Kiri have freed Hohiro Kurita and a number of members of the Fourteenth Legion of Vega. The Clan did not know that they had possession of the Heir to the Dragon and are furious at this discovery. News of his prison break has spread acrooss the indigenous population which has spurred riots and attacks against the clan occupation force.<cf>While Clan security and elemental forces heve been dispatched to deal with the rioters, Galaxy Commander Perez has ordered all Omnimechs to deploy immediately. The Kuro Kiri are using the civil uprising as cover to spirit away Hohiro Kuerita and the members of the 14th Legion of Vega. You are to deploy to the Edo spaceport and ensure the groundnig of all DropShips. No spacecraft should be allowed to leave this system!

ED22DAF04CA7CD40B29B4C816256281F=The Legend-Killer is the near mythical Rifleman of the only seven time Solaris Games Champion, Gray Noton. His dominance over the games for so many years sowed many rumors that Legend-Killer was some lost Star League 'Mech that simply assumed the form of an average Rifleman. After his retirement from the games, Noton became an information broker for the power players on Solaris 7 until his untimely murder. The Legend-Killer would later be piloted by Justin Xiang in the title fight for the 3027 Solaris Championship.
64267BEB4AE2BA5EC7B307922250EFA1=The Luthien Imperial Gardens was meant to be a tranquil oasis within the urban jungle of the Imperial City. Much like Tokyo's Yoyogi park which inspired the location. The main garden is centered on a colossal stone spire, capped with a temple, and skirted by a mote and stone block wall.

20525B51422DF26B482BB5A2EAA962A5=The Mauler technically began its life as the Daboku, originally deployed along the Draconis Combine border in 3038. Codenamed the Mauler by Federated Commonwealth forces, the 'Mech was an utter embarrassment for Kurita and a death trap for any MechWarrior unlucky enough to be saddled with it. When the chassis was redesigned in the 3040's the choice was made to adopt the Mauler codename as its official moniker, mostly in an effort to avoid the stigma of its previous failures. The Mauler's extreme-range weapons allow it to inflict serious damage before most enemy weapons are even in range.

B9A8814F49FEC11DB88B68B80B602CCF=The McKninnons have been loyal supporters of House Davion since the beginning of what would become the First Succession War, and their family's Black Knight, dubbed Partisan has been there almost every step of the way. Keiran McKinnon's 'Mech quickly became a family heirloom. As parts for the aging Star League era chassis become scarce, Partisan sees less activity and more unconventional repairs. While Ian McKinnon is listed as the current pilot, he's only ever seen piloting the 'Mech at public events and serves in the field piloting a MAD-3R Marauder.

25ABCD414420C7DCD51F08AB7FE0A732=The Nightstar was born in the early years of the Amaris Civil War when it became clear that battlefield commanders, especially those piloting Marauders, were being specifically targeted by Amaris troops. Eight months after the SLDF commissioned this heavy support and command ’Mech, the first Nightstars were put into production in 2767. Following Kerensky’s Exodus it became an early casualty of the First Succession War, with both of its production facilities being destroyed in 2786. A pair of Gauss Rifles supplemented with an ERPPC give it unprecedented long-range capabilities.

He represents the antithesis of the Clan's value of honourable combat. And the epitomy of just how far the Inner Sphere has fallen from grace in the centuries since Kerensky's exodus.

Unfortunately, the Cyclops suffers from the mindset that the BattleMech would have ample supplies and supporting units at its disposal.

Bitter close quarters fighting on city streets meant the League was losing 'Mechs to Republic infantry. The SLDF quickly fielded queries to manufactuers for a new 'Mech to solve their problem. In 2777, MatherTechno answered with the Vulcan. Its armament and armor are designed for combat against infantry, and it's effective there, but means it comes up lacking against 'Mechs its own size. The Vulcan is at least highly mobile and presents a narrow silhouette, earning it the nickname 'Scarecrow'.

Every Timber Wolf seen outside of its home Clan was acquired as salvage, a gift, or part of a deal. Stories say many parts of the 'Mech are built by hand, a testament to its quality and craftsmanship. The Timber Wolf was nothing short of an impossible feat in the eyes of the Inner Sphere defenses that first encountered it, further proving the quality of its design. Due to the appearance of a hybrid of the Marauder and Catapult ‘Mechs ComStar gave the Timber Wolf the codename Mad Cat. One of the most well-known Clan ‘Mechs, the Timber Wolf symbolizes everything the invading Clans aimed to achieve on the battlefield. Fast, dominating, and impenetrable.

4214EF734747CFC8823A4B8966FF3D28=The Warhawk is an assault design aiming to take a very precise approach to its engagements. Developed by Clan Smoke Jaguar in 2999, the Warhawk is a semi-maneuverable assault well known for the 4 ER PPCs that allow it to wreak havoc from a distance. Almost all Warhawk configurations are seen with a Targeting Computer to enhance their accuracy at range to bolster its lethality. Due to the success of the chassis, Clan Smoke Jaguar carefully ensures that the designs for this 'Mech never fall into the hands of any rival Clans. All Warhawks seen outside of Clan Smoke Jaguar forces are either stolen or salvaged. The Warhawk was codenamed Masakari upon first contact with House Kurita, naming it after a medieval battle ax.

4A44A65547E60ECC0CBF1BAA75F6950F=The Watch is evaluating everything they can from the wreckage, but so far they have come up completely empty.
E2F2822140BDFF4E3D82BC8FBA0B5F87=The Watch must improve its espionage, or we need to find a new venue for intel. Otherwise, we are stuck with the Dragoon’s outdated figures.
C736836C476C0FEC8BCA6E9318D74808=The Watch…
7AA5539A46A3574BD4DA9B9840781D5C=The administration facility is down.
3CA69A934A17BDF1BE1B0280F77692A4=The area is well defended.
97B0F2EC4F23875AB818618ADB6CE4F9=The armada is almost here. When it arrives, there will be no stopping it.  I told you Jayden, I will not become a tyrant like Perez and the rest of the Jaguars!  Come with me, all of you.

AC7792F84BC4F6401DD8ACB751DE3B24=The barbarians detonated an explosive device inside one of our bunkers. Many officers reported dead. Some of their own citizens were caught in the blast as well at the nearby Meibutsu club.
3FC314684ED709D86E5CDBB32DBC9A53=The barbarians detonated an explosive device inside one of our bunkers. Many officers were reported dead. Some of their own citizens were caught in the blast as well at the nearby Meibutsu club.

6E5F4BE14B37D0532CBBA19015133E6D=The batchall transcripts show Hohiro attempting to play off his forces as green. Dietr was a fool to fall for such an obvious deception. Especially after what he himself witnessed when Hohiro escaped Turtle Bay.
14A19E454EF15479629172897256CAE6=The battle is lost, but the war is far from over. Terra was always the true prize. Is this world really worth losing Terra over?
A09F48CE45BA38A1CDE7A8B5325EE73D=The beating it took breaking atmosphere has weakened its armored hull. Our ‘Mech’s weapons should be able to directly damage it now.
C8E60BD84E778C07F034BFA68EC4BC77=The black box attached to this 'Mech has been corrupted leaving little information beyond its unique chassis identifier 'K-9'. What little we could uncover from its data banks seem to indicate that it served around the time of the Amaris Civil War that precluded the collapse of the Star League. Possibly serving in the conflict itself in some form of civilian defense or urban pacification role. Although for which side, we cannot tell.
DF77B506493BE5C3BA436FA8562E0F26=The bombers are toast. They will have to find another way to match our forces.

C4A4C28A4338C267D94EFEBBEF99AE84=The current status of the Jaguar touman will prepare us for the fight ahead.
5BDB004148DAA90E3E082BB438C64963=The daughter of Colonel Charles Winston, Ariana was a mercenary brat, raised by the soldiers of the Eridani Light Horse. What could easily have turned into nepotism was anything but as she joined basic training after her nineteenth birthday. Forswearing even a hint of favoritism, her poor study skills left her struggling under the extra burden of too many watchful eyes. Despite an inauspicious start, through grit and determination she ultimately graduated top of her class. Upon taking command of the Seventh Striker Battalion, she chose a Cyclops- which she named Sleipnir- knowing the 'Mech's poor reputation would test her skills even further.
17F5FF864045E3D6CD435B9F1E0A043C=The defense of the Draconis Combine Capital of Luthien begins. 
317126D84EBB9918520965B6EA8C1831=The destruction of San Tropez has proven that these Amphigeans have been sheltered by the freeborn civilians of this system. We have witnessed multiple Amphigean splinter groups fleeing our attack. Likely to hide in similar townships.
F9AE6BF24F4E013FFF6CD390925977CF=The destruction of San Tropez has proven that these Amphigeans have been sheltered by the freeborn civilians of this system. We have witnessed multiple Amphigean splinter groups fleeing our attack. Likely to hide in similar townships.

CA66DEC4437993B54405138FF0F0EE54=The door is still locked. The codes may be in here.

7FBCA9594BEBE9B5B68A90B4CA9B4DA4=The enemy should be nearby. Keep your eyes open. We will draw them out by attacking their forces. See it as target practice until the enemy shows up. Everyone ready? Let’s head to our first target.
ECB6FF784C22864BF9F6BEB102A545BA=The enemy will be waiting for us, Cobalt. We will hit them fast, and we will hit them hard. Show no mercy, as the Galaxy Commander said.
1B9BC58A4E254E1C8C5B228F74E636C5=The energy signatures are coming from nearby, but their interference from local geology has made it impossible to pinpoint.
E45B3C244C7A4F800B470A88A62EFD9D=The ever eccentric Bill Wilkes was a famed ambusher attached to the Federated Sun's Fourth Deneb Light Calvary. Insisting to go by the name of 'Wildman,' Bill and his Javelin "Hi There!" lead the Light Calvary in hundreds of successful ambushes throughout his career. Much to the chagrin of his fellow servicemen who found his reckless 'Wildman' persona to be insufferable, despite the success it brought their unit.
7F973E73452CF41C851B92BBAC6D7F5B=The facility is too remote to commit substantial forces to pacify, so I want your Cobalt Star to investigate.
A184678740C16B68D9F477BBED25EE99=The facility is too remote to commit substantial forces to pacify, so I want your Cobalt star to investigate.
17E8E1464537652227E51891FBF6AF90=The fact that the Draconis Combine was only saved by the paid mercenaries of the Federated Commonwealth,

7148EA2842EE831A5B50E49191BD15BF=The filthy cowards will pay for what they have done! It is clear that savagery and barbarism have reigned across Santander for too long. I want these rats purged. No half-measures; hit the ground, put down every pirate you encounter, and clear a path to Valasek’s base of operations so we can launch a frontal assault on the structure. Valasek will understand that stepping on a Jaguar's tail is resigning yourself to a grisly fate. Deliver the message, Cobalt. 
F367DE3548F803E6A4B54B9168851EBB=The first munitions depot is just beyond those rocks.

Values must be greater than 0 and should be greater than or equal to Min Brightness. A good value should be positive (2 is a good starting point), and should be adjusted in a bright lighting situation. For instance, if the value is too small, the image appears too bright. If too large, the images appears too dark. Actual values depend on the HDR range of the content being used. If Max Brightness is equal to Min Brightness, auto exposure is disabled.
757C65C1424C35692473D7A8E3E1ECA8=The maximum forward speed of the 'Mech

D7817DE049738DD8D3CDFDA93FD7FD13=The merchant caste attempted to handle this affair internally. As these ships were their responsibility.
F82A446D4DA071BCDB635AB67F664242=The minimum brightness for auto exposure that limits the lower brightness the eye can adapt within.

8496B1D640EF40DD7DD3F49F6E66648B=The name Silvan Vaughn is probably as fake as the 'Eyes on Democracy' watchdog group he represented. Digging around after him has turned up surprisingly little information, but it seems clear he's been working to destabilize Federated Suns worlds near the Capellan border. Recovering his 'Mech proved equally dry on answers, all we know is that he called his Rifleman 'Diana' and it's not your run of the mill RFL-3N. Clearly Vaughn had some powerful backers.
0FE838884DB1D6AAD0C9EEA56E7F8CA4=The notion of a post-war section of the jungle was considered when exploring the Huntress biome

Designed as a supplement or replacement for the popular Locust ’Mech, the Cicada found limited use by the Star League after its introduction in 2740.

Unfortunately, it only carries the armor of a 'Mech half its size.

30E529AA40934763E283C087E9F71B17=The path to Terra begins here in Turtle Bay. House Kurita and the DCMS will undoubtedly be a more formidable test than Valasek and his pirates, but it will be a battle waged with honor and nobility. You will set down on the battlefield and engage The 14th Legion of Vega. Turtle Bay and the rest of The Inner Sphere is ours for the taking.
6F940EFF48E47E2FE1A49CB3A9F915C2=The path to the Imperial City is open! The 362nd is tasked with securing one of Luthien’s greatest prizes, the main Imperial City campus of Luthien Iron Works!

C2C5B4AA4A5926D23BC8C9BE76693B3E=The personal Battlemech of Jenny Templeton of the Chesterton Reserves, 'Butterbee' mounted quad SRM 6 packs instead of the pair of LRM launchers. During intense urban combat the catapult would be regarded as a primarily long ranged 'Mech, effectively armed only with medium lasers. After a few hit-and-jump attacks with the lasers, Templeton would unleash the missiles. Catching the invaders off guard, the missiles spread out and often hit the holes that her lasers left. If they survived the missile blasts, enemies were usually killed off while still in shock.

77271BD645643134F9E761A6858CDA81=The planetary militia is refusing to stand down. One of our key targets here on Courchevel is now under threat. An old Star League logistics depot remains intact. Cobalt: You must investigate and secure this facility before the militia beats us to the punch.
1EE1BFE44657A4C482EA31B3E11348C5=The planet’s habitable atmosphere, natural resources, and centuries of accumulated scrap from ill-gotten gains have ensured that, no matter how many times pirate bands are stamped out, new residents are all too eager to take their place.

0CDA8D2349BD307C4230F3B706370495=Though initially carrying a blistering array of advanced technology due to its last-minute entry into the Star League Defense Force ranks in 2780, the Trebuchet was also one of the first BattleMechs that went back to the drawing board as a result of the Succession Wars.

Luthien Armor Works, amazed and angered by the rejection, pushed the Dragon into full production in 2754 and sold it to the Draconis Combine, where it would soon become their standard BattleMech.

In one such branch, Khan Elias Crichel of Clan Jade Falcon saw Clan Smoke Jaguar and the IlKhan Leo Showers as enemies, not allies. Fundamentally divided between their proposed invasion plans, the two Clans stood in direct opposition. Something had to give, and all understood this would be settled by blood. Jade Falcon struck first, with an aggressive, all-out attack on Huntress. It is by mere fortune or fate that the invasion would coincide with Kit Jayden's trial in the Huntress Proving Grounds.

If the Amphigean scum is using it as a communications hub, this is a perfect opportunity to sever their contact with their allies and thrust them into disarray.

For safety, I have erased all known records of this facility from ComStar’s database and have encoded new access codes to this transmission. Primus Conrad Toyama is a madman. He is twisting all of our work to maintain the HPG communications network into some kind of religious cult! His supporters are hunting those of us who refuse to indulge his fantasy that our founder was some kind of prophet or messiah! If you are hearing this, if you knew Jerome Blake to be a man of science, then please join us or find refuge wherever you can! Do not let Blake’s TRUE vision of ComStar die with us.

33A653C24D592FD8EF34189F9B424007=WARNING: THIS IS A DIFFICULT MISSION, HIGH TONNAGE IS RECOMMENDED. Time is an endlessly branching river. In one such branch, Khan Elias Crichel of Clan Jade Falcon saw Clan Smoke Jaguar and the IlKhan Leo Showers as enemies, not allies. Fundamentally divided between their proposed invasion plans, the two Clans stood in direct opposition. Something had to give, and all understood this would be settled by blood. Jade Falcon struck first, with an aggressive, all-out attack on Huntress. It is by mere fortune or fate that the invasion would coincide with Kit Jayden's trial in the Huntress Proving Grounds.

D2824DF445162B9E9154D6B14207D8E7=When 'Goblin' left Nik's Cavaliers he was piloting a standard PXH-1K Phoenix Hawk. At some point after his departure he stumbled upon and salvaged a rare PXH-1B which he fondly calls 'Kobold'. With most of the 'Mech's advanced technology destroyed beyond repair, Goblin began a major overhaul to replace the lostech and adjust the loadout to something he was more familiar with. He also bolted on a pair of SRM launchers that he managed to get hold of. When asked about the missiles, Goblin explained that "sometimes y'gotta blow something up real good, and lasers just don't have enough boom!"
3BBBD0CC4101ADFCCDD077A65BDF845B=When General Aleksandr Kerensky laid down the design specifications for the Atlas in 2755, he decreed it should be “a ’Mech as powerful as possible, as impenetrable as possible, and as ugly and foreboding as conceivable, so that fear itself will be our ally." The Atlas met those ambitions, and from its first deployments would grow a terrifying reputation. Heavily armored, heavily armed, and heavily feared, the Atlas is a lumbering monstrosity of firepower.

They shipped out record numbers of Catapults for the three-year contract they had with the Terran Hegemony, but ceased production in 2563 when the contract was not renewed. Primarily a fire-support platform, the Catapult is often used in second line and specialist mountaineering regiments.

EB612295421390D4189973B938D093C4=When first seen by Inner Sphere forces, the Mad Dog was codenamed Vulture. It was believed that the 'Mech was designed to circle the battlefield with its long-range armament, waiting for a chance to strike. In reality, the use cases of the Mad Dog were far more aggressive. The purpose of the Mad Dog was to provide an endless barrage of long-range firepower to its enemies as it closed to deliver the final blow. Although it lacks some of the survivability one would find in the Summoner or Timber Wolf, the firepower of the Mad Dog is not to be underestimated. 
E95834884AB4CF3622D42CAD2799452A=When first spotted by Inner Sphere 'Mech pilots, the Summoner was given the codename of Thor due to the prime configuration sporting a PPC and an LB 10-X AC, drawing the description of thunder and lightning. Among the oldest second-generation OmniMechs, the Summoner serves as a more maneuverable option compared to other heavy OmniMechs. Equipped with decent firepower, armor, and a hefty jump jet complement, the Summoner an ideal multipurpose 'Mech.

106F34B74371330D118DB48D62BA8847=When it was first seen during the invasion, the Hellbringer was dubbed Loki due to every version seen having a configuration that defied all intelligent design in the eyes of the Inner Sphere. The Hellbringer is the frailest of the invasion heavy 'Mechs, sharing many parts with the Summoner to cut back production time and costs. However, unlike the Summoner, the Hellbringer lacks jump jets and does not carry as much armor. What it does bring to the table is an immensely powerful, very versatile arsenal that ensures it is prepared for every possible encounter. 
5D0B91F34F29836B29A61B975426FF14=When originally built for the Star League in 2719, the approach taken by Cosara Weaponries was to create a BattleMech that was easily maintained and well suited for high-endurance raiding far from supply lines. The Crab was seen by many as a reliable standby and the eventual standard for SLDF medium ’Mechs. The League’s collapse orphaned the design, however, and the loss of ferro-fibrous armor production eventually led to centuries where the surviving units were downgraded to carry standard armor. Even still, the Crab’s elegant simplicity practically assured that enough would survive to the present era.

It's the first new 'Mech chassis seen in over a century, and the first to make use of a melee weapon: its namesake hatchet. The Hatchetman's current deployment in city garrisons has been a success, and has seen many enemies succumb to point blank ambushes of AC/10 fire and hatchet swings. This has led to plans for a greater deployment of the design, as well as rumors that the Federated Suns may be receiving shipments of the 'Mech in the future.

Further variants of the Charger manage to undo its shortcomings, but only by downgrading the 'Mech's top speed.

F3D0846F42B498317A9B16ACBC0D9881=Yeah! We’ll take ‘em all on if that’s the best they’ve got!
B7C9C9A24B6A767788ECB3AA7686569A=Yeah! Word came in that the Nova Cats have disengaged and are falling back to their DropShips. After the Cats broke off, the Jaguars soon followed. All Clan forces are in retreat!
587DD3914C3E3BE8CA784786C6E7AA59=Yeah, I am getting it too.
E6D5151D4F62971F789A808EB12834D9=Yeah, I am ready to take these suckers down!
328C81F0440557071B3F228C241B11B7=Yeah, I got nothing.
7AB8D6BD4A283DBEABE2339D1CE3DBBD=Yeah, I kind of am.
105A884846491F93CEBEE7A29B7038A1=Yeah, I think so. The amount of shit we’ve had to sift through due to bad intelligence… I can’t stand around and do nothing anymore, not if I know I can do better.
D63EB745433FFEA1AE352C838AED0932=Yeah, and Mia will not rest until she has brought vengeance on us personally, Jayden.
52CDE51A45AA582CB1FA4B85E905B504=Yeah, and he seemed to be sizing you up right from the start. Mr. Destined For Greatness.
BBB8D1A548D27A96CCAA4B809EA4351C=Yeah, and you put one of those undisciplined surats in one of our ‘Mechs, the raw firepower and precision engineering would be too much for 'em.
BA24627E409D61221D27F68851012B11=Yeah, anything is better than Valasek and his goons.
1670C3E44487A335E4FC3EBDC4FEE756=Yeah, because you would be dead. Get your heads in the game kits! This is for real.
30BE4AC54A47720D9065BCAF53B8C1DE=Yeah, but we cannot stop now.
7B07466B4D1D4CC1FE928B95EC558959=Yeah, but when I was caught, I actually got punished for it.
10A65D844595E14AD4EBBC8AC05BEBE0=Yeah, if you hadn’t gotten yourself in this mess we wouldn’t be forced to bail you out.
9BDC6B144F0EE5484EED06B85108D991=Yeah, just like ol’ Ibrahim’s hot drop regiments on Huntress.
645DBB5C46FA3D364C4104ABBABBDF1A=Yeah, just like the rest of us!
7D70B8A9491336246E3241914DF60E2D=Yeah, just thinking, and trying to stay focused on the task at hand.
A4CEF96E4033BBA37E460ABAEBFF7DC0=Yeah, no kidding.
C30927304F723D01EBA225B40EA2C16B=Yeah, surprised even myself. I guess I am finally growing into my namesake.
509489104BD03841CD02D68C62B42B6C=Yeah, that is true.
2661D05F486C3E6BBC08F3A9F922731B=Yeah, the perfect place to hide your illicit activities.
7373BD214CCEFABDEDC3CB8B0E3F050E=Yeah, they said they were fleeing the order. 
A4CB01E4426F91396B7560905D926EF1=Yeah, they will surrender in a hurry.
26B4629E4DF8C2945C1B9CBC753B3340=Yeah, we can handle anything these surats throw at us.  
1643FCA34C86E6BD8AE055ADD83ED412=Yeah, we do not have time to rebuild an entire industry. Especially if we want to keep pushing towards Terra ahead of the other Clans.
3576F5614B9B2BD193CD38B8A30DF7F7=Yeah, we know! Everybody knows!
5573D56943ABFB380F29599C0E58ABF8=Yeah, we should be more concerned with the ire of an exhausted Perez, if we end up failing out here.
357462C44CA4B2BBB5F477BCFA60267D=Yeah, well, not like their culture is going to be sticking around for too long here.
240A0A7E464053B4A7546CAF0A54796A=Yeah.
46891AE54719966D7FA17FB72232F3F2=Yeah.
8FBA2E3E45FA14284F8C82A31FF3EEAC=Yeah.
AC38E2C34FD13DE9A4A3B6ABEB1F8712=Yeah. After our ancestors went into exile, the Great Houses went to war attempting to lay claim to the Star League throne. After over 250 years of never-ending Succession Wars, the Inner Sphere has descended into barbarism and technological regression.
B51DFF1C4FCD38836A104E9A4683533D=Yeah. Goodbye, Mia. I hope you’ve found your peace in paradise.
CA96BFA54378B742F20F1F9EBD64A964=Yeah. I could really go for shooting something right about now.
08F5315B45D1E32F93320E9E162DF572=Yeah. I was getting pretty restless traveling here. 
80F7FC9E4ED3B9D7D85F3FA72468B232=Yeah. Just a migraine. It will pass.
654F344A4D56E278FD4677BF25E76E61=Yeah. Keep your distance from that thing.
34721BE44E3AF65C7A3D7581F0DDAF31=Yeah. Much worse than the storms on Londerholm.
C83578B842297C0328A6AE80EA10AC92=Yeah. That is true.
06DC31E449541322AFF26D96060088B0=Yeah. The Killers seemed intent on hiding this one away. Will be good to pry into why.
06BBFD8D44AAD3CF28060FAED7FED1C6=Yeah. These should work.
4E3ADA7C4BF062FE9D4B01965AD27D23=Yeah. Though it could be a hell of a fight, right?
0E79F4EE40392079C47404B0CDA8907A=Yeah. Though, speaking to Yuichi, apparently the bushido code teachings are strongly embedded in them the same way ours are with the Great Father’s vision.
FED661224C50580FFFC748AC540FAC2F=Yeah. We are ready for it though. These are… These are enemies like any other.
CA6B48AB4CD19DE2C99A1CB3484D5DD0=Yeah. You’d think with Wimmer in charge and Perez on Wolcott…
2A7BA07041C071E629761A85BD734E5C=Yeah...but my mind still feels every centimeter of that knife going in. No MedTech can get rid of that.
7627E57F4AF874C144C297B54D299A77=Yeah?
962E38FC4B16EB5E00B0FA8F6A7E6048=Yeah? Even when we are superior in every other way?
111121E74A54F8B3371A9CA51D5AA807=Yeah… I think.
DDC619B14341A727A99E02A9E6717A47=Yeah… This looks promising. I’ll need to review it back at base.
D69E1BC747FA6B2CA6230D83D1C09A5F=Years ago, Henrik Cole's grandfather tried and failed to overthow the then head of House Cole. Forced to flee quickly, Henrik's grandfather's BattleMech is one of the few heirlooms that Henrik possesed. No one is quite sure where the name for the 'Mech, 'Basilisk' came from, but reports indicate Henrik liked the name, and revelled in the idea of his 'Mech being named after a mythical creature known for its lethal gaze. It appears he was quite ignorant of the actual meaning of the name, 'Serpent King', and its origin was liklely to have come about as a warning to watch out for the treacherous Coles.
41F078BB4605C4A8DE1ABB8D6333E3CC=Yellow
D19B803745781F86BCFEC29D896A9055=Yes my Khan.

3A19770145F8B07CC4110ABB31DF8234=Yes! Retrieved codes. Hopefully those repair bays are still functional. 
2EA7EEF74735556E0AE30E84AC49AAEC=Yes! These codes will unlock the gates. We will be able to get through now.
52BF443D40BAE1F8AC835894C38D4839=Yes! They are weakening!
CCD103934CF43E9242AE18AD3E141DD0=Yes! You got their reactor!
A468A9274DD14DC25BE182B52769C4F4=Yes!!

F03AF51E434EDF0F40A9F2BFEA8A5539=Yes, Star Commander!
ED29CD95458F90A7FE610190B4494FAE=Yes, Star Commander.
3C2299E14F7ADAA1314ED2AF822A0C1B=Yes, but it can eventually give way. Lay into it with everything you have!
098A8399486ABCB6ADFE60BF45D85164=Yes, he murdered millions of innocent people, but the Smoke Jaguar’s CONDEMNED HIM for that! Cordera Perez is a pariah because of his actions! Did you know what Jinjiro Kurita did to the world of Kentares? He ordered the systematic murder of an entire planet! Fifty-one million souls murdered by Coordinator Kurita and the DCMS! Twelve times the death toll of Edo with ZERO repercussions! And they have the gall to call us monsters! Where is the justice for all the countless billions dead on the order of this Kuritan regime?
0913C0124B6E8941C59711A2F5877D24=Yes, my Khan. 
7D18030B45393ACC0F71C48C75529A79=Yes, my Khan?

ED9B782D4D15B072C55261A4C21CBB0E=Yes, that is precisely what we will do here. The Fourteenth have fallen back to the outskirts of the city of Edo.
F3173083425CEEB92E49A694013D2F7B=Yes, that is precisely what we will do here. The Fourteenth have fallen back to the outskirts of the city of Edo.
70895F5B4C90499E1AAF79843B17021F=Yes, they are.
3DA377DB4B595FE02928F3BFA22E8935=Yes. But after threatening retribution, someone has finally come forward to claim responsibility,  a rare act of honor amongst these people.
1487673444F95B93C019D28595AC29F6=Yes. But after threatening retribution, someone has finally come forward to claim responsibility; a rare act of honor amongst these people.
88349E7A4E8156B6955A0BB0CAAD6495=Yes. It is like Perez once said. They will do anything to destroy us, even if it means destroying themselves.
741044534F759F902D28B2A66B1ECC47=Yes. The interrogation shows he harbors no love for House Kurita or his former handlers.
DC44C26B497C560868D6C69CFD33BCD2=Yes. We have committed to defend the capital of The Draconis Combine against any enemy that threatens her. We are ready to do our part.
6BFB5069485859C80BD5B2A63284086D=Yes. We must remember, though, Perez may have fallen, but the rest of Smoke Jaguar is still out there. And they will not stop until Luthien is overrun and their path to Terra is free of obstruction. 
12A56E0648F9971C644BA29AB84BEF81=Yes. We still have an edge.
85697F4948A6134ED4360D94A6E27C19=Yet we now must contend with multiple regiments of mercenaries that were not accounted for in our plans.
E487DA40493929DB6C7544846EBAD7C2=Yet we now must contend with multiple regiments of mercenaries that were not accounted for in our plans.
0535EA614709936104CD22B7D872EDBF=Yokota
A18A7BCB4518BC854864CCB377533C3B=Yokota
B94BF8ED418106A1DD17819BAD7188C2=Yosha-! 'Mech terminated!
548E647B4D7B485C283BD2AC4E2CCC4B=Yosha-! Another down!
578A377B447C40EAAB049C88D9D8F96D=You Amphigeans have no honor! You insist on endangering the lives of everyone here while sending your men to slaughter! This madness could have been avoided!
38054CA24640C1E9F0716784BA057CA3=You abandoned all of us for your own selfish desires! 
0AAA5BC24B6F3225B86B66AD453E0BB9=You accepted our batchall! This is the fight you agreed to!
AF9DF40C402D2ADABFB93B995AE64B2D=You act like Perez will relegate us to turning wrenches and pushing brooms if one gets away.
D22FBFF54C992325B9C55C92A373D03F=You adopted a freeborn into our ranks? Why would you take such a risk? These surats are fanatically loyal to the dragon.
989DD92C4597407D2770B1BA860EA7D9=You all fought like true samurai warriors. The holding remains ours.
53CF5A79401616D5556170B16152D545=You all have your assignments.
C516586346135621E7132993E2591BDE=You are a clan warrior!
88F99C294ABB2504B965259762F9EE73=You are a deranged animal that must be put down, and nothing more.
3901DF6B4020DA58060A79B3A41E3B46=You are a sick joke! You think you will be remembered as anything but a mass murdering lunatic?
835EEF174A6828C8C7E4C889302913AB=You are as naïve as ever, Jayden.
0EB414B04748970EF78C6E9014B107C6=You are being assigned to Delta Base, which the Watch flagged as a likely high-priority target.
6E58A6F8457F044356A7C0B0FE5078C4=You are being assigned to Delta Base, which the Watch flagged as a likely high-priority target.
3736634940B44A1C829CE0B4E749F205=You are coming up on an industrial district, Cobalt. Watch yourselves. Plenty of shops that can be used to patch up ALAG ‘Mechs.
6802886E44186F3DE4576E847C7645DE=You are currently behind the controls of mankind's premier weapon of war: A Clan OmniMech! Although this is a training exercise, you are still controlling four stories of ferro-steel and myomer muscle strapped to a fusion engine. More than enough power to kill and be killed. You WILL respect that fact while you live under my command! If you do not, I will kill you myself, and spare the laborer caste your incompetence. Now, follow the marked nav route.
80F6B36949ECF36E8A319799DF59A649=You are delusional if you think we would ever go with you. Not after everything you did.
B3A29ADB495601391BED58AF48BB5078=You are free to hack it if you find it. I know that kind of stuff is right up your alley.
5F423F3C4ED01F358BECDA9C2DC13402=You are insane.
A7F34E7847CF123105E4AE9BD8B8B465=You are not grieving for the traitor you were duty-bound to kill, but for the friend he was before he strayed from the path. Trust me when I say it will pass with time.
4AB8DA85485F42839B14A19B3D65EE93=You are right, Cordera. I was unwilling to face you then, but I will NOW! I invoke the ritual of zellbrigen and challenge you to a duel of warriors!
09F0DA9A49FABEDB5BA94BBC67FFCE2D=You are tasked with investigating each target structure. Data on backup supplies and stockpiles could prove invaluable in finding the hole Valasek is hiding in.
748741AD43498D9091C4F3ADD8584312=You are tasked with investigating each target structure. Data on backup supplies and stockpiles could prove invaluable in finding the hole Valasek is hiding in.
CE1146804774DA931B58B49BA1F9F00C=You armored demons have wreaked enough havoc! Your reign of chaos ends now.
DD5C9DC549F24FE201041EA1F31CA16C=You assholes are so fond of challenges? WELL, HERE I AM! COME AND GET ME!
99BEF721494AC1DDDC3FA79DFAB65305=You bastards! You will die for what you did!
419387F8454B7DA7E299E4866F0854D5=You better get on it then.
90D1AA504967349970FA4C89D44E9D77=You better. Or you will find yourself replaced. 
AF5DDBD74E88391FBF43108A8C657C0D=You better. Or you will find yourselves replaced. Am I understood?
2F7CB04542080AAFCFC930B11E0A3F34=You call for a duel and then have your star interfere? And you call into question MY HONOR? You and these underhanded Kuritan freebirths deserve each other!
72950B4642A8B1A821843B8A8C65C7FB=You came through for me, Cobalt. Unlike Shadow Binary, you executed and performed like true Smoke Jaguars. We do not tolerate weakness within our ranks and you have shown none.
29E8B24D4401E9777B806BA8463D6FDC=You can now configure your 'Mechs.
8A4718D54B60D53EEC97C3915AD78B7E=You can now purchase unlocked Chassis, Weapons and Equipment.
849AB1B3481D6FB4F767A5A804591163=You can now upgrade your 'Mechs, Weapons and Equipment.

0EA8D2C94AC425CF9CCFDD88472F3019=You cannot be serious!
F2A6372F40EED0DB3AAE1F9F2821A94E=You cats can batter us all you want, but you’re gonna leave your share of blood on the floor.
393D9EF64D590CB05A776B93E4B27A30=You chose this time and battlefield, it is not our fault you were not prepared for us!
B323BE894BFCAF89205A4891C6F63460=You come back in one piece, or you should not come back at all. 
3CC1E2D447B2B47ACAB166B7020B150C=You dare chastise ME about honor, Jayden? Look in the mirror! Cordera Perez is not the only Jaguar with blood on his hands. What about all the future vile acts the Jaguars will commit in the name of Kerensky? Will you feign ignorance then as well?
569332EE4030B8C0255B66AC500551CF=You dare lecture me in our ways, TRAITOR?
3E890CE44051A160E4B25D83ADD8AE09=You defected! You are not my family! You are not even Smoke Jaguars anymore! But I am. And when you fall, you will understand what that name truly means.
BFF359C5427CF2165CACD9B7F0378B15=You did good, kid. You got in, got out, and mostly in one piece. Can't ask for much more, really.
8DD7FB5542BDC7ACC66DDDA5B8D0491D=You did the right thing given the circumstances.
E6333AA04FE8AE4E7B9E658872578BCC=You did well to crush the resistance of the Fourteenth, but MechWarrior Ezra taking that free birth as a bondsman could prove to be a lethal risk.
0E6DBA5945C36968F16302B99A9F2881=You did well, Cobalt. You did not hesitate, and those surats could not withstand your assault. If any rats happen to stumble out, they will be dealt with swiftly - and harshly. Nobody will slip through our grasp! 
DC25DF7542317E29A514DFB5E7B15648=You did what now?
E09E714D4CF33D2E3610B093E8AA42E4=You earned your place. And your mother’s lineage to the Yoshida line improves your claim.
20F26EA54D8C4C95203831B4F884E6E5=You executed the plan to the letter, Cobalt. The ISF played right into our hands. Those rats could not stay hidden forever. Smoke Jaguar claws have pierced their flesh, And like all others that stand before us, they are now scorched debris. Kerensky continues to bless us and our liberation of the Inner Sphere. 
B36A001241147B135AD91285A432171F=You five are the final vestiges of your brood who some deem might one day be of value to the Clan.

A00102284454F4555FBF4FA18A447797=You have a lot of gall telling me what is right and wrong. Did you really believe abandoning your home was right, Naomi? Or were you just trying to run from your own failures before your betters finally put you away to pasture where you belong? In the solahma clusters!
174DE0C84907A418D57993AB0535AD82=You have achieved more than just mission success, Cobalt. You wrested those prisoners from Valasek's grasp. Thanks to you they are no longer possessions subjected to an endless cycle of torturous and inhumane acts. 
4F4388CD40C2BF4E4D89D7AE2E32740C=You have an opening to the DropShip! Take it! Before the Cats collapse on you!
C3A23A244875397FFBE52BAEB1EF4023=You have become more twisted than I even thought, Jayden. I will free you from your madness. And remember you for who you were, not a pawn of this ruthless Crusader path.
FEB202204E3ED542F5A1BDB49649735D=You have been assigned to a moon that ComStar has tracked the message back to, in order to find this armory and take control of it for us.
3D58FB3D434AF6545085438CDCC55B83=You have been assigned to a moon that ComStar tracked the message back to, in order to find their hidden base and take control of it for us.

F4255C94442A6A082116AF9D0EB6F8E9=You have:

681CC2624C3416316FC9F28DB3ECD448=You heard her, Cobalt. We are right back into the fire. Stay mobile and support one another. If you can maneuver a clean shot at those guns, take it.
9F631F9D484967C09E23219EE74281DC=You heard him Cobalt! Do not relent! Do not show any mercy!

F0DBBDED4FE63A7B4195CA99D6571E17=You heard the Star Colonel. The ALAG has gotten wise to our mission and has fallen in to support the final structure. Pick them off at range and thin their numbers before we advance on them. We do not know how many of them there are.

778DB337458A7F958FDB9F8B22D66B1A=You kits are in for a treat. Leadership in the Clans only goes to those strong enough to claim it. SaKhan Weaver is among our best. It is a shame that she was denied the Khanship after Leo Showers' ascension to ilKhan.
EB5D502140B870743A9532B55191F84B=You kits have been coddled by too many fights with Spheroids. This... This is what a real fight is. In trials against other Clans, unless an opponent offers you hegira, expect no quarter until there is only one side left standing.

He has already been given the honor of adoption into the Smoke Jaguar’s warrior caste, something no freeborn has done in over a century.

F4FA38EF47DDC001EA51708E75314620=You mean something other than deep space travel rations?
09999E14413169DBFB061EA06BF40802=You monsters will never win!  Not after what you did at San Tropez. Not after what you did at Edo!

CA09329D4E3FBD0AC681B1AD1409FA60=You must be so proud… bringing wanton destruction to yet another world.
77B0F74049BCC0EC9DAB77A0B6388E87=You must dispatch this lot quickly if you do not want to be overwhelmed.
3FFD02D44DF84649F20F3BB6F6044D67=You must find and destroy whoever commands these mystery BattleMechs.
640DC1494A719CB41C1C9F98B20E8949=You must insert and investigate the sources of the heat spikes. Once you visually confirm the target DropShip reactors, destroy them.
7D7E021D4FD2708928C70BB00BA42647=You must insert and investigate the sources of the heat spikes. Once you visually confirm the target DropShip reactors, destroy them.
128552BD42A45F8EF5B2B59E10378027=You must restart the game client for mod changes to apply
1A92766D47C6534E67524DB9E5A45D97=You must secure this base. Should it come under attack, ensure its structural integrity.
57E0E970413F24B1DFA59D867CADBBCA=You must secure this base. Should it come under attack, ensure its structural integrity.
B3FBB255463A688FEF7DDDACF3ECC1FC=You need to tell her.
A9D3873D4E86C0DFF35E19BF45EB12C9=You never did get it, did you, Ez? I have no interest in helping him infect our Clan any further. He was barely better than the Feudal Spheroid Dictators. The ones you now fight to protect. That is why I will not stop until you have been put down too.
EE56540D457575B53849B7BAF360D2A0=You never know, we might get lucky and serve in the same cluster.
9A72519A42EEBD48156047842B3278A5=You savage bastards are begging for a dose of your own medicine and we are going to shove it down your throat!
36C12CE5458C5A7A31F25F8BCE926215=You seem out of it.
2700DB99450B9CB4F17A0A993771D02F=You should have let him be. He is a traitor. He does not deserve the satisfaction of an honorable trial.
5E165D844365E1BF493AAEBB5BD0B3A2=You should have let him be. He is a traitor. He does not deserve the satisfaction of an honorable trial.
CBB934A64B8A9F4BD5DBE09303D92B83=You should just focus on keeping up with us, Star Captain.
6B5091D64221FC67925BAA89A367E879=You should make quick work of them.
09B2309E4433F8D23D3A1C95BCFD2CEA=You sound like you fear claustrophobia more than the DCMS.
96A13FE74859BA6F6938BC8C9904572C=You sound like you know from experience.
EF25936F45989E48244DD39BA232A6BF=You still fail to see it?
DC4971FF413F64CD8105148CDB8D54A7=You still think your bondsman can win the hearts and minds of these violent spheroids, Ez? 
B3D8387D495C69BAA892DDA934AB0E30=You stood up to Star Colonel Wimmer on Mia's behalf.
E7A70798447046996E2D28BE7D455095=You stupid Snakes never learn. Santander is MINE!
341909B84CF1BEA083896E8E346474DE=You sully the Great Father’s teachings. You twisted his vision! You slaughter indiscriminately!
6B70DA6E41B2F6F1D7C3C8BD215953BB=You surats able to be prepped and ready in the next fifteen mikes, quiaff?
B8748BB64383A3DCA54FB59F611E11DF=You think I WANTED to do that? Mia, after we lost Liam, you were GONE! You pushed all of us away and sought comfort in the Clan’s indoctrination. I couldn’t trust you no matter how much I wanted to.
1C931D0E4E114DFA7B9A558540721CDE=You think he is serious? About killing us if we do not make the grade?
97B0A45444F0458A67A15FB50AC7420D=You think so?
9C57B57143C294C9E162F880EBE39001=You think so? Who would have thought.

B70B4E4F4436158A516081BD3F6C8178=You think this is just about hardware? No. You fight with ferocity, but we fight with HEART. That cannot be measured in hardpoints.

668156D54A29CED6D8E3E88CEF2B314E=You think yourselves better than Perez? I saw how you acted at the LAW facility. The indifference towards life and infrastructure you claim to be above... It’s not too late. I can beat you and take you as bondsman.
0EEE580B4EAB4C2B90F2D48CF05955B7=You think, if we pile enough of them up on the battlefield, some vision of defeat will deter them?
C45834A946BA49C562F8FCAA80D94B35=You threatened me on MY planet and thought you’d escape with your life?

5CEDD7EA46A90593B67B4EB24F944CE6=You underestimated your opponent, Kit. If Londerholm’s rejects can best you, that does not bode well for your own Trial of Position.
5F703846479B9ADAFCDF8DA174C695DF=You ungrateful little pissants! I gave you everything and THIS is how you thank me? Fighting against your former kin?

6A3392354A8C5921BA381FB746D7BA67=You would rather we gift these Spheroids our tech? Is that what your freebirth has been whispering to you, Ez?
7C10C53C4A2276783F4475934D454356=You wouldn’t believe it if I told you. After his death, I started looking into his stuff. His programs, his messages… Even at the end, he was sticking his nose in the craziest things.
7DA5A1A143C2EC888636798D520863F7=Young kits: you are nearing the end of your Sibko training. A mock battle scenario awaits you for today's exercise. Head down the river valley and eliminate your rival sibkin. Now it is time to find out who is worthy to fight amongst the ranks of The Smoke Jaguar and help us reclaim our homeland and realize the great father's vision. May Kerensky guide only true MechWarriors through this trial.
